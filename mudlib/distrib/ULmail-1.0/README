MUD Mail v1.0
-------------

mail.c:		user command to read/send mail
editor.c:	simple global editor for entering text
mailbox.*:	mailbox object
maild.c:	mail daemon
		--can be used with provided mailbox object or new
		mailbox object can be created which has functions prototyped
		in mailbox.h
		--can also use provided or different editor for
		entering text

You will probably need to edit maild.c and mail.c to change the #defines to
suit your mud.  You may also need to define a few small functions to
compensate for the use of local simul efuns in the code.  If your mud doesn't
support the discworld color codes (ex: %^BLUE%^) you should edit maild.c
to remove them.
