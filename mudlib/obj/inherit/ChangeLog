    * more.c:  Changed more_file() to use the file_length() efun to
      calculate the percent of file displayed.  This whole thing still needs
      to be re-written.

Wed Apr 17 11:22:56 1996 (tmcintos@knapp38.res.iastate.edu (Tim))
    * more.c:  Rewrote some more; simplified the more_* functions by adding
      global variables.

Sun Apr 21 20:01:29 1996 (tmcintos@knapp38.res.iastate.edu (Tim))
    * container.c:  created base container object
    * object.c, room.c, living.c, armour.c, weapon.c, shop.c:
      . updated with respect to changes to object.c needed to produce
        container object.
      . added new functions for weight and bulk, cleaned up some old code
        in these areas.

Mon Apr 22 20:43:24 1996 (tmcintos@knapp38.res.iastate.edu (Tim))
    * room, shop:
      . worked on weight and bulk some more; receive_object()
      . added code for replace_program() in the create() functions
    * living.c:
      . changed long() to use new efun list_obs() for a better display of
        inventory when looking at an object.

Mon Apr 22 21:57:28 1996 (tmcintos@knapp38.res.iastate.edu (Tim))
    * object.c: changed set_ids() to add_ids()

Fri May  3 15:49:58 1996 (tmcintos@knapp38.res.iastate.edu (Tim))
    * cmdline.c:  Changed the way flags are handled, hopefully optimized
      it to some extent.

Tue Jul 30 23:46:39 1996 (tmcintos@knapp38.res.iastate.edu (Tim))
    * more.c:  Streamlined a little...still needs rewritten from scratch
      in my opinion.
