    * intermud.c, intermud.h:
      . Changed to version 3 of the I3 protocol.
      . removed functions that sent the outdated mudlist-req and chanlist-req
        packets, and related code.
    * ucache_d.c:
      . Created this daemon to handle the caching for the I3 'ucache' service.
      . Daemon should be fully functional, but still need to add code to use
        it in the 'channel' service. (it doesn't support emotes right now).
