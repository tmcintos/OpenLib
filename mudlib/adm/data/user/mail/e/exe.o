One isjust to have it use the global editor that Evergreen is working on.  Youcan check with him for details on that or see the /doc/projects/editor.sys.The other is a 'reply' facility; I think this could be handy.  Have you done any coding on the BBS stuff yet?  I think it is probablywell-defined enough at this point to start implementing it.  Let me knowif you have any prob's.later!Tim",/),})
