The idea is to helpmodularize stuff, and to get rid of the ::create() calls etc., forthe average wizard who just wants to create simple objects.  (alsoseparates clone setup procedures from master copy setup procedures)...of course that stuff may need revised.  I'm going to do some more work with security I think and see if I canget something working...I'm doing the work on the copy of the mudlibhere at home and uploading the results...which reminds me that FTP isvery insecure right now because anyone with an account could basicallymodify any file in the lib using 'put'...oh well. :) Tim",/),(/0,"Tim@Dysfunctional Mud","Security","To: quint@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Tim@Dysfunctional MudDate: Fri Jun 14 00:27:18 1996Subject: SecurityCC: -------I think I may actually have a working security system on my homecopy of the mudlib.  If I get it working good enough I'll upload thechanges to here.  It does a full check of the call stack and usesobject privs.  Also keeps track of wizards and domain memberships aspart of its job. later,Tim",/),})
