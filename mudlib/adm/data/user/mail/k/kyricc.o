Looks like it still strips outthe stuff in the #include statements since they use <>'s but that probisn't too important.  I think there's a HTML tag to represent actualbrackets but I'm not sure what it is...might also be an escape characterto use...Laterz",/),(/0,"Tim","Re: object_types.h","To: kyriccFrom: TimDate: Mon Feb 26 00:18:14 1996Subject: Re: object_types.hCC: BCC: tim-------2048 = 2^11 (2 raised to the 11th power)You don't need those values, you just always test against the defines.The numbers represent bits in a binary bitstring where each bitdetermines whether some attribute is on or not.  You use bitwiseoperators to set and test these bitstrings.  They are &, |, ^, ~bitwise AND, OR, XOR and complement (NOT).  Examples:a = 101011010b = 001001101 (in binary...actually would be in decimal form)    ---------    001001000 == a & b    101011111 == a | b    011101000 == a ^ b    010100101 == ~a    110110010 == ~b(assuming I haven't made mistakes...you just do these bit-by-bit ANDis true if they are both 1, OR is true if 1 or the other is 1, XORis true if they are both the same (either 0 or 1) complement is theexact opposite.)  Now you're a computer engineer :)laterz",/),(/0,"Tim@Dysfunctional Mud","Re: MUD","To: kyricc@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Tim@Dysfunctional MudDate: Fri May 24 18:08:46 1996Subject: Re: MUDCC: -------Hmm..this machine shouldn't have been down...don't know how that happened.

I've done as much testing as I really can getdone with the tools available to me (not to mention the lag over the USlink); there is no reason I can see to prevent it from working. If there are bugs, please let me know - I should be able to fix them in myoff moments. I've got exams in a bit over a week, until the 28th of June,so if I log on at all between now and then, it'll be a major miracle :-)(or a sign of incipient boredom :) ) In terms of other projects - I'd have a look at what's on offer, but fora slight problem: ls, and other wizardly commands, don't seem towork for me. Anyway, I should be logging on late in June/early in July - look forwardto hearing from you between now and then. Cheers.",/),})
