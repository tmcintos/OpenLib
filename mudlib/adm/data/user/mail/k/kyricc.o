You use bitwiseoperators to set and test these bitstrings.  They are &, |, ^, ~bitwise AND, OR, XOR and complement (NOT).  Examples:a = 101011010b = 001001101 (in binary...actually would be in decimal form)    ---------    001001000 == a & b    101011111 == a | b    011101000 == a ^ b    010100101 == ~a    110110010 == ~b(assuming I haven't made mistakes...you just do these bit-by-bit ANDis true if they are both 1, OR is true if 1 or the other is 1, XORis true if they are both the same (either 0 or 1) complement is theexact opposite.)  Now you're a computer engineer :)laterz",/),(/1,"Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional Mud","Porno land :)","To: kyricc@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional MudDate: Tue Apr 23 23:13:21 1996Subject: Porno land :)CC: -------Hehe,      I happend to notice that in your directory.
