I currently have just the channels andmudlist code implemented for stock CircleMUD.

I tar'ed up the code that I havefor you, Im not sure how much help it will be at the moment, andI didn't write up any docs on it. Im not sure when I will get ina mood to work on it again, but I figured that I could atleasemake the code available to anyone that wanted to pick it up andwork on it. Rust said that 'tim@Dysfun...' was interested in it.I included a patch, the imud3.c and .h files, and the Imud3 libthat I used. The lib could use alot of cleaning up and has aton of warning messages, but it works fine. Let me know whathappens or if you know of some people that want to work on thatcode as a project and I'll start up a mailing list and maybeget inspired to work on it again. In the mean time, Im convertingthe stock Circle worlds over to a Lima Mudlib on ArcadiaF. Ifyou want, the address is noc.cc.cc.ca.us 9999 and Im Bishop onthere... Later",/),(/0,"satan@Lima Bean","Re: I3 - Circle","To: kyricc@Dysfunctional MudFrom: satan@Lima BeanDate: Sun Nov 17 20:10:13 1996Subject: Re: I3 - CircleCC: -------On Sun Nov 17 17:04:03 1996 Kyricc@Dysfunctional Mud wrote:> Got your mail.
