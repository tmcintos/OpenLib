Thought you were on therealready.  We are now aliased to dm.imaginary.com 4444 so that shouldstay the same reguardless of any future site changes. As far as permissions, make sure you can edit your home dir (I'll checkthis on my end), but probably just create any new stuff (or modifiedold stuff) in your home dir and then let me know when it's ready tobe installed.  This way I can keep track of what is being done to thebase source. You should have read access to everything--if you don't then let meknow; if you really need write access to something for some reason letme know and I can set it up...just trying to keep this organized *evilgrin* Until we get boards/news in, you can let people know what you're workinon by mailing to the mailing list (dysfunctional@dm.imaginary.com). later,Tim",/),(/1,"Tim","Re: Privleges","To: dryghar@Dysfunctional MudFrom: TimDate: Wed Sep  4 11:15:59 1996Subject: Re: PrivlegesCC: -------on second thought, just tell me what you're gonna do (better, sendit to the mailing list) and tell me which specific directories you willneed access to and I can set that up.
