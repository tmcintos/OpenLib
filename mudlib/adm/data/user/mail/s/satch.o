I am in the processnow of getting hooked up with Nightmare (got access etc.) and I thinkI could be more helpful by improving that lib instead of trying to writeone from scratch (esp. since NM4 is way more solid than the originalNM3 that I was dissatisfied with). If you or anyone else wants to try to make a go of the OpenLib stuff,have at it...I made an informal release under the GNU GPL a while back...that was the main goal--to make good code available to the general public,which they could use to produce quality MUDs... Anyhow I will provide the site for it's development while I am in school(not May-Aug) if someone else wants to work on it; and occasionally helpout here and there. I also said, if you read the MOTD you already saw it, that I am interestedin starting a playable mud based on NM or Lima (probably NM) if there isenough interest in it (i.e. at least 3 or 4 people besides me)... later,Tim",/),})
