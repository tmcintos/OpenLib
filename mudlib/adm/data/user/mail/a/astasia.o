I don't understandmuch of it because I have never looked it over and this is the firsttime I have looked at it with the intention of inderstanding it.  Oneproblem I see or have with it is the way the to_hit is figured.  BasicallyArmour Class has NOTHING to do with whether or not you can hit something.If affects the amount of damage only.  Instead of using the ac[] to helpfigure the to_hit probability you should use the 'dexterity' stat.  Aneasy way to look at it is like this: Ac = the amount of damage the armour you are wearing can absorb before     the remaining damage is applied to you.  For example:  If I hit you     for 100 points damage and your armours ac can absorb 55 points of     that damage then only 45 is applied directly to your HP. Dextrity = Your ability to control your body, your weapon, and other dealing with your 'physical' control of your environment.  If your dexterity is hit you are more agile, more accurate in wielding yourweapon.  Basically a low dexterity means you are clumsy.  If you swing yousword you are the type ho hit everything but what youwanted to hit. If none of this makes any sense let me know.  We can add stuff in therethat may affect these in different ways too.  If you are weak you areto have a worse chance of hitting your target if you are using a veryheavy sword.  Armour can be a factor depending on the 'type' of armour. *shit* If you are wearing nothing but simple leather armour, you have freemovement...the armou is light and flexable.  But if you are wearing fullfield plate you might have a hard time hitting things because the plateis 'very' heavy and it does not allow the range of movement that otherarmours allow.  I dont know how detailed you want to get with this, butthose are just some ideas...I definately dont like ac being used to figurethe to_hit probability though. Just my .02 worth.... -K",/),})
