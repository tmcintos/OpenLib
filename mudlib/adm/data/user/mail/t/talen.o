As far as commands not working, I'm prettysure it must be a problem with your path.  Finding an elegant way tomake that sort of thing easier is one of myongoing projects.  I might have to talk to you online sometime to getit fixed.  You could try:set PATH /cmd/wiz:/adm/cmd/wiz:/cmd/player:/adm/cmd/playerand see if that fixes it..hmm but it probably won't because the'set' command is in a wizard directory I think :)Well, maybe by the time you login I'll have a better solution...later,Tim",/),})
