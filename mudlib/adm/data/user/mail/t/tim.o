One question, though, which is indirectlyrelated: where is the code for the 'eval' command stored? I was going topatch it so that it set euid's correctly after I got this: eval 'object ob=clone_object(\"/u/t/tim/board\"); ob->set_board_name(      \"testing\"); return ob->move(environment(this_player()));'and I got:runtime: tmp/tmp_eval_file.c line 6: *Object must call seteuid() priorto calling clone_object() which I guess says #define AUTO_SETEUID isn't defined in the driver.I was going to add a create() apply to the code it generates, but I wasn'tsure where it was at. How are you testing it? I was playing aroundwith the code but I did no permanent alterations. Evergreen",/),(/0,"Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional Mud","Heya.. the more command is strange","To: tim@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional MudDate: Mon Apr 22 01:19:48 1996Subject: Heya.. the more command is strangeCC: -------Heya,      I don't know if you will get this or not, but I have 2 questions.  The first one is.  Is the 'more' command screwey on everybodys terminals.. or is it just mine.. it prints a long line of ~'s.. it scrolls right off the screen.. even at startup.        The sencond question is, how do i get the 'ls' command to pring the files and directions accross instead of downward.  I know in normal UNIX ... ls -C does it accross if not already. but that doesn't seem to work.. thanks,   --hamnsnock",/),(/0,"Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional Mud","ls & more","To: tim@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional MudDate: Mon Apr 22 15:31:34 1996Subject: ls & moreCC: -------Heya... this is what i see when i type 'ls': nmsh% lsevilforestpatastuffworkroom.cnmsh% and i did the setnenv, and the more still just goes... ^ ^ .. ack i mean it goes:  ~ ~ ~ ~   like for a page or so then stops heh.",/),})
