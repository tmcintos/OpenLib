It's in my directory on Lima Bean:/wiz/rust/lpcval.{c,h}Hasn't been touched in a long time... A few different systems haveused the code, so it should be OK, but I'm not 100% sure that thecode I'm pointing you at is the most recent version ;-)If something is wrong w/ it, or if you need something added to it, cometalk to me.What're you working on, if you don't mind me asking?John",/),})
