One question, though, which is indirectlyrelated: where is the code for the 'eval' command stored? I was going topatch it so that it set euid's correctly after I got this: eval 'object ob=clone_object(\"/u/t/tim/board\"); ob->set_board_name(      \"testing\"); return ob->move(environment(this_player()));'and I got:runtime: tmp/tmp_eval_file.c line 6: *Object must call seteuid() priorto calling clone_object() which I guess says #define AUTO_SETEUID isn't defined in the driver.I was going to add a create() apply to the code it generates, but I wasn'tsure where it was at. How are you testing it? I was playing aroundwith the code but I did no permanent alterations. Evergreen",/),(/0,"DrYgHaR@Dysfunctional Mud","Yeah...","To: tim@Dysfunctional MudFrom: DrYgHaR@Dysfunctional MudDate: Tue Apr 23 08:58:36 1996Subject: Yeah...CC: -------Sure I'm still contributing...

(not every group would have a bboardfor it of course)  The news would be handled by a daemon and couldthen also easily interface with the intermud stuff.  The implementationon IdeaExchange and other libs is very usenet-like...I think that isprobably a good way to go. Well, let me know what you think about this. Tim",/),(/0,"Talen@Dysfunctional Mud","Re: banishd","To: tim@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Talen@Dysfunctional MudDate: Sat Jun  1 22:57:43 1996Subject: Re: banishdCC: kyricc@Dysfunctional Mud-------w.r.t. banish daemon (sorry about the delay, I had a bit of fun trying tofind the post office...*sigh* too used to Shattered Worlds, I guess) - yes,it should be ready to go. I've done as much testing as I really can getdone with the tools available to me (not to mention the lag over the USlink); there is no reason I can see to prevent it from working. If there are bugs, please let me know - I should be able to fix them in myoff moments. I've got exams in a bit over a week, until the 28th of June,so if I log on at all between now and then, it'll be a major miracle :-)(or a sign of incipient boredom :) ) In terms of other projects - I'd have a look at what's on offer, but fora slight problem: ls, and other wizardly commands, don't seem towork for me. Anyway, I should be logging on late in June/early in July - look forwardto hearing from you between now and then. Cheers.",/),(/0,"Evergreen@Dysfunctional Mud","Re: Bulletin Board idea","To: tim@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Evergreen@Dysfunctional MudDate: Wed Jun  5 09:52:46 1996Subject: Re: Bulletin Board ideaCC: -------I've implemented this before for MudOS 0.9.
