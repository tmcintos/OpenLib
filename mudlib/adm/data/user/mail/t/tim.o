One question, though, which is indirectlyrelated: where is the code for the 'eval' command stored? I was going topatch it so that it set euid's correctly after I got this: eval 'object ob=clone_object(\"/u/t/tim/board\"); ob->set_board_name(      \"testing\"); return ob->move(environment(this_player()));'and I got:runtime: tmp/tmp_eval_file.c line 6: *Object must call seteuid() priorto calling clone_object() which I guess says #define AUTO_SETEUID isn't defined in the driver.I was going to add a create() apply to the code it generates, but I wasn'tsure where it was at. How are you testing it? I was playing aroundwith the code but I did no permanent alterations. Evergreen",/),(/0,"Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional Mud",".login/.nmsh.rc","To: tim@Dysfunctional MudFrom: Hamnsnock@Dysfunctional MudDate: Tue Apr 23 01:25:57 1996Subject: .login/.nmsh.rcCC: -------Heya,      Is there away to make something automatically happen when you login.
