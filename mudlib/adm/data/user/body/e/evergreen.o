If you are","  reading this you prolly already know the site name, but just for your","  information it is:  canaan.de.msstate.edu 4444.","","* Due to the fact that Tim will have VERY limited net access for a time, I,","  Kyricc, will assume duties of mud admin.  This is temporary till Tim gets","  access again.","","* I will (as much as possible) try to keep the mud up and running as much","  as possible.  There may be interruptions if there is a bug in the driver","  or any other MAJOR bug.  This is due to that fact that I am not as good","  at finding the bugs and fixing them as Tim is.","","* Any mail for the mud can be sent to the following addresses:","","     tim@canaan.de.msstate.edu","","     kyricc@inetnebr.com","","  I will respond as quickly as possible...","","* If i have left any improtatnt info outta this motd I am sorry."," ","* Tim has internet access now: mailto rockford@novia.net","  As usual mail to astasia@iastate.edu will also get there.","","* I am creating a new FTP server for the mud.  I have currently implemented","  enough stuff to be able to login and get a file in either ascii or binary","  mode.  I still need to do alot of work and clean up the code somewhat, but","  what's there should work.  Try it out if you get a chance and report any","  bugs to me.  (port is 4443)  --Tim","","* Implemented STOR for FTP daemon get/put should work in both modes. --Tim","","","","","You have NEW mail.","","","",})
