New items are","  usually added to the bottom of the list.","","* I moved some directories around, mostly stuff got moved into /adm.","  There is a new include dir there, simul_efun stuff got moved into","  /adm/obj/daemon where it should be, as did the /obj/daemon/net directory.","  Save files got changed a little too.","","SECURITY stuff is mostly in place.  I've noticed problem already having to","do with callbacks from high privilege objects.  Quint, Ev and Tim should","have priv 1 access and everyone else should not right now.  Use the command","'lswiz' to get a list of wizards, and 'lsdom' for a list of domains.  Please","report any bugs in the system to me (Tim).  DOCUMENTATION can be found in","the file /doc/mudlib/systems/security--This is the original documentation","on which the system is based.  Better documentation later hopefully. :)","","","",})
