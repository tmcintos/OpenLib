Right now you should be able","  to get and put files in both ASCII and BINARY mode.  Try it out if you get","  a chance and report any bugs to me.  (port: 4443) --Tim","","* Check out my ~tim/TODO list for things that need to be done.  New items are","  usually added to the bottom of the list.","","* SECURITY stuff is mostly in place.  I've noticed problem already having to","  do with callbacks from high privilege objects.  Quint, Ev and Tim should","  have priv 1 access and everyone else should not right now.  Use the command","  'lswiz' to get a list of wizards, and 'lsdom' for a list of domains.  Please","  report any bugs in the system to me (Tim).  DOCUMENTATION can be found in","  the file /doc/mudlib/systems/security--This is the original documentation","  on which the system is based.  Better documentation later hopefully. :)","","* CHAT command:  I changed the syntax...you don't need a ':' anymore. -Tim","","* Changed it so default for more() is to exit when done paging.  setenv","  MORE_NO_EXIT_END to change this.  (this is opposite of before) -Tim","","* TERMINAL TYPES: Once again supported properly..although few are supported.","  **hint, hint--project idea**  If your terminal type is unknown, it will","  default to \"default\" which does nothing.  If you set the environment variable","  DEFAULT_TERM to a value this will be used instead. -Tim","","* MAIL has been bumped up to v3.0  A few small things have changed like","  deletions which are now marked as deleted and aren't committed until the","  mailbox is saved.  See the online help in mail for more info.","","","",})
