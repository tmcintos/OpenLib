# /adm/etc/group
#
# group file used for file permissions
#
# format: declare a group by placing it's name in parenthasis at the
#         beginning of a line, followed by a list of userids.
# - Comment lines _MUST_ begin with '#'.
# - Userids must be lower case.
# - Userids must be delimited by commas.
# - Spaces are allowed, they will be stripped out.
# - Group declarations may be continued onto the next line; remember not to
#   leave out any commas.
# - If no members are listed, all users are assumed to be members.
# - To include all members of one group in another group, list the group
#   name in curly braces, in the same manner as a uid.
# - Each line must end with a newline character. (duh)
# Example:
# (clowns) roost, bek, dacart
# (dorks) {clowns}, jerk

# People who need complete access
(root) Root, {admin}

# People who run the mud
(admin) tim, casper, kyricc

# People who do mudlib work
(mudlib) {admin}, kyricc, lol

# The system's uid
(system) System

# Domain groups, domain uid (directory name) must be a member!
(base) base

# Hmm, who could this be?? (leave this one blank always)
# If you want to LOCK the mud, define this list as the allowed users.
(all) {mudlib}, hamnsnock, quint, treble
