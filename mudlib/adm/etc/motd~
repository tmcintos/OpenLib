New USER/SHELL couple is in place for testing.
  The base for all bodies is /obj/clone/user.c.
  The default (and only) shell right now is /obj/clone/shells/protosh.c.

There is a 'bare bones' shell available in /obj/clone/shells/ssh if you
want to go with the basics.  No features.  Can use as a building block.
Note that this one will cause problems if your path is not already set.
(which it is if you can read this :)

Everything should work (except for LPC expansion and one other thing) in
protosh now.  Includes globbing, history, variables, aliases

Check out /obj/clone/shells/protosh.doc for documentation on protosh.
Not elegantly written but if you want that you can do it. :)

I ported over the Nightmare Shell and it seems to work now.  It's in
/obj/clone/shells/nmsh.c --Tim
