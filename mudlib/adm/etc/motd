New USER/SHELL couple is in place for testing.
  The base for all bodies is /obj/clone/user.c.

NOTE: I changed the setup so the shell shadows the user.

Everything should work (except for LPC expansion and one other thing) in
protosh now.  Includes globbing, history, variables, aliases

Check out /obj/clone/shells/protosh.doc for documentation on protosh.
Not elegantly written but if you want that you can do it. :)

Shells in /obj/clone/shells:
  nmsh --   port over of the nightmare shell. aliases, history, nicknames
            Has various cmds for wizzes; cd, pwd, pushd, popd, scripting (nmsh)
  protosh   Tim's experimental shell...basically just me messing around trying
            to do various things: cd, set/unset, alias/unalias, history,
            globbing, variable substitution, quoting...see the doc for it.
  ssh --    Bare bones shell...doesn't really serve any purpose right now
            but could be a user shell w/no features
  rsh --    Restricted nmsh; I had to hardcode a few things since wizardp()
            doesn't work yet to make it a user shell.  Only allows access to
            user commands.
