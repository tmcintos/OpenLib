The OpenLib Mudlib Development Project has been abandoned.

If you are interested in creating a playable MUD based on either
Nightmare IV or Lima mudlibs, please send mail to Tim (astasia@iastate.edu)

Also, I am working on the beginnings of a JAVA based mud.  Descartes@Nightmare
has already done work in this area; I am producing one from scratch.
Send mail to me (Tim) if you want in on this.
