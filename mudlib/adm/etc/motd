* Please send mail to Tim if you want to become a developer.  Additionally,
  all developers should join the mailing list by sending mail to
  majordomo@knapp38.res.iastate.edu with the string 'subscribe dysfunctional'
  in the body of the letter.

* If you want to take on a project or have any new project ideas, send mail
  to Tim.

* There is now a 'changelog' command which appends an entry to the ChangeLog
  file in the current working directory.

* Changed set_ids() to add_ids() in OBJECT. Make changes accordingly.

* Going through a major revision.  Modularizing inheritable objects, anything
  derived from BASE will find out that create() is declared 'nomask'.  You
  should use initialize() in place of create() in derived objects.  See BASE
  for the code as it stands right now.
    Basically have 3 functions, initialize(), low_setup(), and setup().
  The setup() funcs are for initializing cloned objects (as opposed to the
  master copy without the # in its name).  low_setup is used in the mudlib
  and setup() is reserved for the end user (that way you don't have to call
  ::setup() all the time).
    Note that this is subject to change, so don't make your fixes yet unless
  you don't mind doing it again.
