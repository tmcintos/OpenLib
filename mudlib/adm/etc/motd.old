* Any mail for the mud can be sent to the following addresses:
      mud@dm.imaginary.com (primary address)
      rockford@novia.net (Tim), astasia@iastate.edu (Tim during school)
      kyricc@inetnebr.com (Kyricc)

* I am working on a new FTP server for the mud.  Right now you should be able
  to get and put files in both ASCII and BINARY mode.  Try it out if you get
  a chance and report any bugs to me.  (port: 4443) --Tim
  NOTE: this project may be abandoned in favor of an external ftpd process
        due to efficiency--this would have to interface w/the mudlib though.

* Check out my ~tim/TODO list for things that need to be done.  New items are
  usually added to the bottom of the list.

* SECURITY stuff is mostly in place.  I've noticed problem already having to
  do with callbacks from high privilege objects.  Quint, Ev and Tim should
  have priv 1 access and everyone else should not right now.  Use the command
  'lswiz' to get a list of wizards, and 'lsdom' for a list of domains.  Please
  report any bugs in the system to me (Tim).  DOCUMENTATION can be found in
  the file /doc/mudlib/systems/security--This is the original documentation
  on which the system is based.  Better documentation later hopefully. :)

* Changed it so default for more() is to exit when done paging.  setenv
  MORE_NO_EXIT_END to change this.  (this is opposite of before) -Tim

* TERMINAL TYPES: Once again supported properly..although few are supported.
  **hint, hint--project idea**  If your terminal type is unknown, it will
  default to "default" which does nothing.  If you set the environment variable
  DEFAULT_TERM to a value this will be used instead. -Tim
  "ansi" or "vt102" are probably the coolest if you support them. (setenv)

* MAIL has been bumped up to v3.0  A few small things have changed like
  deletions which are now marked as deleted and aren't committed until the
  mailbox is saved.  See the online help in mail for more info.
