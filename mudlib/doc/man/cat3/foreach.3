       The  foreach() control structure provides a convenient way
       of doing operations on each member of an array.  For  each
       member  of  the  array  passed to it, <var> is set to that
       particular member, then the statements between the  {  }'s
       are  executed.   This  is repeated for every member in the
       <array>.

       This example would be similar to a 'who' command.

       object ob;
       object *userlist = users();     // see users(3) (array of users)

       foreach(ob in userlist) {
         write(ob->short() + "0);
       }

       Could also do this:

       object ob;

       foreach(ob in users()) {
         write(ob->short() + "0);
       }

       This is equivalent to the previous example.
