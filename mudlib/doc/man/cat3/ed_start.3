       This  efun is available only if __OLD_ED__ is not defined.

       The internal editor is started, optionally loading  'file'
       for  editing.  The resulting output is returned.  The edi-
       tor session remains active, and further calls to  ed_cmd()
       can be used to send commands to it.

       If restricted is 1, the commands that change which file is
       being edited will be disabled.

       Only one ed session can be active per object at a time.
