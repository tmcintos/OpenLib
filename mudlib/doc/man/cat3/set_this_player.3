       this_player().   This  efun   is   only   available   with
       __NO_ADD_ACTION__  defined,  and  is  included  since with
       __NO_ADD_ACTION__ parsing and dispatching of  commands  is
       the mudlib's responsibility.

       who  can  also  be  zero, in which this_player() is set to
       zero.
