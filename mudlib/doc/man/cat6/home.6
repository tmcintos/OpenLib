       This command is a shortcut  for  wizzes  that  'TELEPORTS'
       them  to  their  workroom.   If you do not have a workroom
       yet, you need to copy the  file  /obj/clone/workroom.c  to
       your home dir.  You may make any changes to the workroom.c
       file once it is your  home  dir,  and  this  command  will
       transport you to this room from anywhere in the mud.
