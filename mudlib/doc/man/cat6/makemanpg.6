       makemanpg(6) is used to produce a nroff  ready  man  page,
       which  can  then  be  used  with Unix's man command, or as
       nroff source to produce a text file formatted in the  tra-
       ditional 'man' style.

       makemanpg(6)  should  be invoked giving the section number
       as its only argument.  A list of sections is  provided  at
       the end of this page.

       When makemanpg(6) is invoked, it prompts the user to enter
       a command name.  This should  be  the  name  of  the  com-
       mand/function  being  documented.   Next, the user will be
       prompted  to  enter  a  short  description  for  the  com-
       mand/function.   The  short description must be entered on
       one line, and should usually be less than one  line  long.
       After  the  short description is entered, the user will be
       prompted to enter the SYNOPSIS field.  This  field  should
       show  how  to the command/function may be invoked, listing
       all possible forms.  This field may contain several lines,
       and  a  ** should be entered on a line by itself to denote
       the end of the section.  Next, the user will  be  prompted
       to  enter the DESCRIPTION field.  This field is the 'body'
       of the man page, and should describe how to use  the  com-
       mand/function.   This  field  is  unlimited in length, and
       should be entered in  the  same  manner  as  the  SYNOPSIS
       field; enter a ** on a line by itself to denote the end of
       the DESCRIPTION section.  Next, the user will be  prompted
       to  enter  the SEE ALSO section.  This section should pro-
       vide references to related commands/functions  and  should
       be  entered in the same manner as the DESCRIPTION and SYN-
       OPSIS fields, ending with a ** on a line by itself.

       When entering any of the fields, raw nroff commands may be
       included  to change the format of the man page.  Most com-
       mands are preceded with a period (.) and a few are  listed
       in the following section.
            sp n   insert n spacing lines
            ce n   center next n lines
            na     no alignment of right margin
            PP     begin new paragraph
            SH t   section heading follows; t is the heading
            NF     don't format the next block (?)
