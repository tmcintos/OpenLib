       resolve_path() returns a full path given a  starting  path
       'current'  and  a relative path 'new'.  All relative paths
       are supported, including ".", "..",
        "~",  "~/",  "~user",  and  "here"  (this   returns   the
       file_name(3)  of  the  environment  of this player.  NOTE:
       this should normally be called via the RESOLVE_PATH(string
       path) #define that will ensure the proper path is returned
       for this player.
