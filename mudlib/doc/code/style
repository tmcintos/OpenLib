Mudlib Style Guide (incomplete until it says it isn't)
------------------

All mudlib code should be structured and well documented when it is finished.
(duh)

Commenting:
-----------
  All files longer than 30 lines or so should include a comment block at
the beginning of the file stating the filename, author, date, and description
of what the program is intended to do.
  Anytime a non-trivial modification is made to a file, it should be noted
with the date of modification and coder's name below the header comment block.

Indentation:
------------
  When producing code for the mudlib, use an indentation level of 2-3 spaces
to improve readability and uniformity.

Variable Names:
---------------
  All variable names should be descriptive, and if the variable name consists
of 2 or more words, they should be separated by an underscore '_'.
ex: home_directory

Function Names:
---------------
