All 2 armed races SHOULD use the same identical function for query_unarmed()
And more importantly, the how to of the clay race:
To use:
inherit MONSTER "clay";
and then in the create() func:
FIRST! (before EVEN ::create();)
set the following:
set_armour_types(*string new_at)
set_armour_locations(*string new_al)
set_base_ac(int *new_ac)
set_hands(int new_hands)
set_unarmed(*mixed new_combat_info)
THEN ::create();
See /include/races/human.h to see what these funcs do (untill I write
the docs on it).  It IS assumed that these monster will not wield any weapons,
as bonuses are not allowed for in the clay 'race'
then anything else you want in the create...
