Port over from TMI-2 or code fresh:
trace (Finds all active copies of an object and optionaly destructs them)
ss (scans an object inventory and returns it's contents, filenames & oids)
sc (like ss, but it works with the deep inventory)

Possible idea:
Create a 'command pre-processor' inherent in all commands that allows
for the command syntax:
command <arg>[, <arg>[, <arg>...]] [except <arg>[, <arg>...]]
and possibly allow for counts of and/or pluarls of objects so the
following commands could be possible:
sell all except wielded weapons, worn armours
get 3 daggers, 2 short swords
put dagger except gold dagger in pouch
---
I do have an idea how this could be done.  Casper
