I meant to ask what was going on with the bully-boards, too. I know
Exe is handling them, but he hasn't logged in for nearly a week.
 
As for the shells, I had an idea for them. How about having something in
user.c's process_input() that calls process_string() in the shell, and it
does the work? That way, players can choose between shells, and each 
shell maintains its own alias and environment structure. (This means
though that the shells, since they have to keep globals, have to do 
their own save_object() to preserve their data, unless we keep the
environment and aliases in user.c.) Upon entry into the mud, user.c calls
boot() in the shell, which makes a clone of it, loads the aliases, returns
its instance to the player; thereafter, process_input() calls the shell
using that instance, and when the player quits, the user calls the shell
done(), which cleans up and destructs. 
 
Just an idea.
