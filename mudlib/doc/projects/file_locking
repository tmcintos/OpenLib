By Tim 3/30/96 -- this is really rough

Ok, how about a system that prevents modification of any file in the mudlib
(wizards home directories excluded) by anyone other than 1 person who has
"checked out" the file (like an RCS).  To save overhead I think all files
would have to be automatically locked by default, then the daemon could
keep a list of unlocked or checked out files (only these files could be
written/modified etc.).  You could also check out or unlock a directory.
I say 'unlock' in the sense of disabling the system's protection because
when doing major modifications it would just get in the way.
