How to get started with this mudlib

1.  Get MudOS v22 and compile. (The lib was developed using  v22.1a6)
    The options.h file that was used in development is included as
    /adm/etc/options.h

2.  Edit the config file and start the driver.  The config file used in
    development is included as /adm/etc/config.  Also edit
    /adm/include/config.h to make any necessary changes.

3.  Login as "root" to create the bootstrapping character.  (This is defined
    in /adm/include/security.h and the privs associated with it can safely
    be removed once you set up another admin character.)

4.  Create an admin character for yourself by logging in with the name of
    your choice.  Then, from the root character, do:
	mkwiz your_char_name_here              (makes you a wizard)
	addmem your_char_name_here Admin       (" " a member of Admin domain)
	chmem adm your_char_name_here Admin    (" " an administrator " " " )

    (Admins are soley defined as administrators of the "Admin" domain which
    can also be changed in /adm/include/security.h   Right now, being a
    member of the Admin domain also makes you an admin, but this could be
    changed to have a different meaning)

5.  From your new admin character, do:
	rmwiz root   (gets rid of the privs of the bootstrapping char)

You should now be ready to go for the most part.  Since the lib is incomplete,
you will have to 'ls' /adm/cmd/* and /cmd/* to find out what commands are
available to you.  Most will print a usage string if you just type the name
of the command.

Tips
----
  Configuration of your user is handled through environment variables,
(commands: setenv, unsetenv).  Most commands which have UNIX counterparts
use the same name as in UNIX.  A notable difference is 'chprot' (changes
protections on files and directories) vs. 'chmod' in UNIX.

  Read /doc/mudlib/systems/security for an overview of how the security stuff
works.
