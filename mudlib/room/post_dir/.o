It's just that you can't get into the chapel to get yourbadge. You just have to go to the room where you kneel and write 'atone'and you will get your Bath-title.....:)...When your alignment is good andyou get your badge you'll just have to write 'exa badge' and it will tellyou all advantage you have by having this badge. The different commands willbe more when you advance in level automatically! Example, at level 5 you geta magic misile you can use when you fight monsters. it costs you about 10 SP'sbut it helps you a lot!If you looses your (good)-alignment you looses the badge, but you can just go back and get it again, when you've become good again.Anyway, i'll tell you something silly...my alignment is at the moment onlynice....:(, cause i got impatient and killed alot of good guys just too get]the XP's!
