 <P>Welcome to the land of the lost.  This is basically a what have I/am I
 doing page.  All comments are my own and I hold no responsibility for them.


<P>I will start off by telling you a bit about my experience with mudding.  I
began mudding on the original Highlands LPmud, which in my opinion is still
one of the best muds I have ever seen.  Also at about the same time, I started
playing Vincent's Hollow 91, which became VH 92 soon after I started playing.

<P>From there I bounced around doing freelance coding for various LP's writing
and installing ftpd's.  I then landed a full-time quasi-admin job at Pyrsphere
MUD.  Here I did extensive work on the virtual-grid daemons.  Everything was
Peachy Keen.  NOT!!!  One day out of the blue Pyrosphere ceased to exist, and
with it all of my work.

<P>From there my old roommate (Tim@Dysfunctional oddly enough) informed me that
he had started his own mud and was looking for help.  Out of the ashes came
BrazilMUD.  BrazilMUD was fine and dandy, however, again to my suprise after I
eperienced a shot time of not having net access, I came back to find Brazil had
vanished.

<P>In the aftermath of Brazil, I took to liking diku-type mu, of which I
played Northern Crossroads.  And I still maintain characters there today.  I
was again contacted by my former roommate about a new project of his called
DysfunctionalMUD, but more importantly the developement of a mudlib from ground
up called UltraLIB.  I dove into the project full force.  I have managed to
slack off a bit since then, however, I am still here and after a turbulent
summer of DM going up and down and really being quite unstable I am ready to
complete our mission.
