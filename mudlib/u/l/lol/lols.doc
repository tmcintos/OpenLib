This is Lol's project history and log.  Please read this often to keep up
with what i'm up to . . .

10/15/95  Created set_items in the standard ROOM
          Created exa.c player command to view object and non-object "items"
          defined in rooms by <set_items>
10/16/95  exa.c seems to work perfectly.  Let me know of any problems or
          optimization techniques i could have employed.
10/16/95  began work on an emotes daemon.  Not sure how this will work
          yet because i've never seen one.  However, i have a couple of ideas
          that i will try (starting with the lowest CPU & RAM idear)
10/17/95  Well, emotes are going along very nice.  Initial test seem to work
          smurfingly.  The workings of it:  In user.c, commandHook call cobj 
          to look for commands.  If that fails, the emotes will search
          /cmd/emotes for a file matching the verb.  If found, it continues
          with the emote.  It's still in the baby stages.  No frills, yet.
          I'll continue working on it and probably change it into a daemon,
          so as not to clutter up user.c.
          
          To create an emote is simple, thought it may change soon.  You simply
          ed <emote> with NO extension, and then a generic action description.
          try <smile>.  Look for changes in the future.

 * Emote Note:  You will rpobably notice that the emote will return the
          3rd person (tell_room) action description to you as well.  This is for developmental perposes.
10/19/95  Still working on emotes . . . in trying to perfect, i have
          succeded in going backwards.  I'll keep us up to date.
10/22/95  It's early AM and i just got off work.  I wasn't ready to deal with
          some of the complexities of creating "smart" emotes, though i did
          some testing which was positive.  I discovered a couple of errors
          that i will correct when i'm in a better mind.  i changed <say>'s
          output format (you'll see) to a more "text?" state.  IMHO, this is
          a better form of output for say, shout, tell, etc. because it
          appears in a format as though you were reading a book, instead of
          typing on a computer.  Well, I need opinions on this to either
          change say back to "You say:" or change the rest of the commands
          to the You say, "something." format.  Let me know if either i am
          stepping on toes or out of bounds by this, and you opinion.
10/26/95  Uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhggggggggggggggg . . . i've finally getting over
          my 48 hour bug.  Obviously, i've made no progress in that time.
10/26/95  Well, emotes is nearly done.  I need some guinne pigs to try it
          out on.  Still working on loading the emotes into memory.
10/28/95  OK, emotes are done, except for some testing i need to do when 
          others are present.  Any errors, lemmie know.
          Well, emotes are coming.  I'm not quite in the mindset for coding,
          so i don't know when it will be here.  I still feel crappy, so live
          with the delays.  Sorry.
          Oh, yeah . . . fixed user.c so a what? will return if command fails.
