# The commands in this file are executed every time you log into the mud.
# (more precisely, LOGIN_D forces you to do a "source ~/.login")

# As you can probably see, comments begin with a pound-sign character, and
# end at a newline or a semicolon.
#
# Any special interpretation of a script file is up to your shell.
