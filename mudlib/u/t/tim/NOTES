-Finger via intermud should return the player's title also
-display idle time right in general finger
-shell idea: enter history buffer and go into char mode--using arrow keys to
 find and edit a command.  Then go back into line by line mode once return is
 pressed.
-inetd: make separate general purpose queue object & use.  Rewrite all that
 queueing stuff. MAKE IT WORK!!! Everything is getting called except the
 overload of eventRead() why the heck...
-multiple clients for inetd.  Have an obj array and only clone clients as
 needed. This can be done after the kinks are worked out w/1 client part.
-mail: use more() for paging header output
-rwho service: take out call to more() since it won't work with tp == 0
shell::move() should let LOGIN_D move it
stuff to edit when moving in new body/shell:
  logind
  su command
  quit command?
  chfn command (not directly needed, but do it anyway)
