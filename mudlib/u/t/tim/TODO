-mudlib security
-player bodies, shells, shell interfaces (set cmd for env variables)
-prompt changing
-hit/spell points, damage
-max weight funcs for races
-monsters etc.
-bulletin board
-put command
-dest command: options for file argument, and dest all instances...
-help command/system uses help() and help_desc() in the command obj.
 help on commands get from object, topics from /doc/help/{player,wiz..}
 Search by keyword with -k flag (uses help_desc() to search commands)
-mail system: daemon, mailbox, command (partially done) (intermud part left)
-emote/feelings daemon/commands (rewrite)
-leveling system
-guild system
-races (work on them) (languages??)
-parties (prolly after more of the basics are in place)
-fix the wildcard expansion stuff in user.c:189 so it works when spaces are
 entered on a blank line.  Ultimately remove this stuff from user.c and place
 elsewhere (in wizard body).
-move /data/user directory to /adm/data/user
-wording in combat--fix something about unwielding a weapon
-flags in objects...store as string array(?)
-define funcs for storing screen length/width(?) and change /obj/clone/user/more
-bug,idea commands log to /log/BUGS /log/IDEAS
 also log to wizards' home dirs if files belong to them
 Could these commands take an object as a possible argument for reference?
-who command: spruce up a bit...some may have to wait for levels etc.
-exa command: merge in with 'look'
