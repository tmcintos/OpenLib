I totally rewrote the editor's mechanics, and the qedit command works. The
code is now made 100% portable ... if I read it right, it should even
compile just fine under 0.9 (boggle that, eh? ;-) The qedit command demos
it. Try editing your workroom with it and see what yout think of it.

p.s. anyone doing a shell or interface? I'll volunteer ...
