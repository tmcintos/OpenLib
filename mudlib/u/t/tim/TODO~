-mudlib security (big one)
-file locking / revision control system
-bulletin boards (Evergreen)
-put command (Kyricc)
-mail: make it use more() and do the intermud part (Tim)
       -add group expansion via GROUP_D for mailing to groups
-Banished names.  Implement this probably as a daemon that maintains an array
	of names.  Could be incorporated into logind?  Would require a
	savefile. (Talen)
-emote/feelings daemon/commands (rewrite)
-hit/spell points, damage funcs. in living.c
-living funcs: query_drunk()
-races (work on them) (centralize into some sort of daemon? languages??)
-monsters etc:
	-set_aggressive() in monsters plus related code
	-any other needed stuff in monster.c
	-max weight funcs for races
-dest command: options for file argument, and dest all instances...
-help command/system uses help() and help_desc() in the command obj.
	help on commands get from object, topics from /doc/help/{player,wiz..}
	Search by keyword with -k flag (uses help_desc() to search commands)
        Help should also search for objects in the immediate environment that
        may respond to the id==topic and check for help() in them.
-changelog command
-bug,idea commands log to /log/BUGS /log/IDEAS
	also log to wizards' home dirs if files belong to them
	Could these commands take an object as a possible argument for
	reference?
-news daemon
-leveling system
-guild system
-parties (prolly after more of the basics are in place)
-who command: spruce up a bit...some may have to wait for levels etc.
-double check all weight related funcs and money related funcs. Update docs.
-(un)subscribe command:  make these take a list of channels
-WWW gateway for MUD Mail
-command to add local->remote mappings via set_alias() in chatd
 function itself needs to do checks for validity too.
-implement error packets in inetd and rest of OOB services (Pending completion
 of I3 spec. (found on CIE homepage)
-intermud.c: fix to use shutdown packet when shutting down (in remove()?)
-finish mudlib programming style guide
more.c:	-rewrite more() for better efficiency and to take a func pointer
		to call. (partially done) (TIM)

-user bodies, shells, shell interfaces: (Evergreen, Tim: work in progress)
	-redesign the way connection, body and shell are related.  All
		administrative stuff should be in the connection, while all
		game-play stuff in the body, and shell should affect look-
		and-feel (no?)
	-environment variables (I think these should be in player and have
		get_env() type funcs.)
	-alias, var, wildcard and any other expansions done in shells
	-revamp the way race and combat functions are included in the bodies
	-prompt changing in shells
	-make inheritable with wildcard expansion func in it (move out of user)
-snoop command
-object. needs work...
-room.c: make long() always ret a string array too... will have to change
 this standard for all objects.
-ucache: finish this daemon and related code (Tim)
-shutdown() -- efun for this that checks root permissions etc...
-change semantics of looking at objects to call long() with 'look at' and to
 call interior() (or something) with 'look in'
-change mudlib to use __DIR__ which is a handy thing I just discovered...
 Don't you just love undocumented mud drivers?!
-ls.c: add an flag to sort files by modification date
-list idle time as hh:mm:ss or dd:hh:mm:ss in the general finger report.
mail: when editor aborts while doing a reply, make it come back to the
command loop if possible.
-linkdeadedness: save messages from when you were linkdead in a buffer.
Give option for viewing on reconnect.  (possibly only certain classes of
messages or configurable)--This should be a shell feature.
more():  Fix it so when exactly one screenful is displayed, it will exit
instead of saying (END) and prompting...This is when MORE_EXIT_END is defined
of course...
-login_d: change it so any member of domain admin gets priv 1 (?)
-fix errors in net daemons caused by my change to server.c
-fix security hole created by programs like changelog which use a callback
 from a daemon with priv 1 access.
 Probably just means being careful when writing such commands...maybe more.
-unsetenv command is a symbolic link to setenv...now is in wrong dir...
 remove and fix sometime.
-problem with CMD_D?  When path is garbage we get problems with security_d
 and too long eval...problem is prolly in get_file_protection
