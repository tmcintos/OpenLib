       This is a bogus command that when invoked  destroys  every
       existing  object that is loaded into memory at the time of
       invocation.  If the command fails, it  will  return  zero.
       Otherwise  it  will  return  1.   If  a  player  or wizard
       attempts to invoke this command, the  respective  player's
       interactive  object  will  be destroyed, leaving all other
       objects untouched.
