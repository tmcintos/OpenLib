makemanpg - make a nroff ready man page for a command or function

.SH SYNOPSIS
makemanpg <section #>

.SH DESCRIPTION
makemanpg(6) is used to produce a nroff ready man page, which can then be
used with Unix's man command, or as nroff source to produce a text file
formatted in the traditional 'man' style.
.PP
makemanpg(6) should be invoked giving the section number as its only argument.
A list of sections is provided at the end of this page.
.PP
When makemanpg(6) is invoked, it prompts the user to enter a command name.
This should be the name of the command/function being documented.  Next,
the user will be prompted to enter a short description for the command/function.
The short description must be entered on one line, and should usually be
less than one line long.  After the short description is entered, the user
will be prompted to enter the SYNOPSIS field.  This field should show how
to the command/function may be invoked, listing all possible forms.  This
field may contain several lines, and a ** should be entered on a line by
itself to denote the end of the section.  Next, the user will be prompted
to enter the DESCRIPTION field.  This field is the 'body'
of the man page, and should describe how to use the command/function.  This
field is unlimited in length, and should be entered in the same manner as
the SYNOPSIS field; enter a ** on a line by
itself to denote the end of the DESCRIPTION section.  Next, the user will be
prompted to enter the SEE ALSO section.  This section should provide 
references to related commands/functions and should be entered in the same
manner as the DESCRIPTION and SYNOPSIS fields, ending with a ** on a line
by itself.
.SH NROFF COMMANDS
