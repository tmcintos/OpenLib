.SH NAME
foreach() - loop control structure

.SH SYNOPSIS
foreach(<var> in <array>) { statement; ... }

.SH DESCRIPTION
The foreach() control structure provides a convenient way of doing operations
on each member of an array.  For each member of the array passed to it, <var>
is set to that particular member, then the statements between the { }'s are
executed.  This is repeated for every member in the <array>.

.SH EXAMPLE
This example would be similar to a 'who' command.
.nf
object ob;
// initialize userlist to array of users
object *userlist = users();

foreach(ob in userlist) {
  write(ob->short() + "\n");
}

Could also do this:

object ob;

foreach(ob in users()) {
  write(ob->short() + "\n");
}

This is equivalent to the previous example.
