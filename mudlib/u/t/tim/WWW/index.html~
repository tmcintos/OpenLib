<H4>(Mudlib Administrator)</H4>

<HR>

 Welcome to my homepage. I've actually got a little bit of stuff here to
 look at now, so go nuts.

<U><H2>History of Things (As told by me)</H2></U>

 I wrote this so I wouldn't have to tell this story anymore *grin*.

<H3>About me</H3>
 I'm a senior (1st year) majoring in Computer Engineering here at
 ISU. The reason I say first year is because I will be here for another
 three semesters, due to the fact that I was an Aerospace Engineering major
 until my junior year. I originally started playing MUDs 4 years ago
 on the first incarnation of the Highlands LPMud, which I still believe
 was one of the most interesting LPMuds around.  After about a year of
 being a ``player'' and never having become a ``wizard'' (At that time
 Highlands used the old LP2.4.5 policy of granting wizhood at level 20,
 and I never spent enough hours to advance past level 16) I set out to
 learn about the internals of LPMuds on my own.

<H3>The Brazil LP</H3>
 I found a copy of the old 2.4.5 mudlib via FTP somewhere and was set
 to learn.  I originally tried to run the 2.4.5 driver, but since I was
 an Aerospace Engineering
 undergrad at the time and had no pratical knowledge of C to enable the
 driver to compile, I searched until I found a copy of the 3.1.2 driver,
 which actually compiled without further assistance. After a few months
 of experimenting I became fairly proficient at LPC and decided to move
 on to bigger and better projects. A couple of my friends got interested
 in LPC and we decided to turn this experiment into an actual MUD to be
 opened to the unsuspecting public. (One of these people was my former
 roommate who is actually involved with this project, Kyricc.) The MUD
 was dubbed ``Brazil'' after the Terry Gilliam movie of the same name
 and began its life here running on one of the Project Vincent
 workstations. Eventually Brazil
 was forced to move due to space constraints (and the mere fact that it
 didn't have permission to run on PV machines) to a new site at the City
 College of New York. This became its permanent home where it ran for
 nearly a year, the last few months of which it was actually opened to
 the public who seemed to enjoy it. The success of Brazil was short-lived
 however--a new admin at its site enforced strict quotas which ultimately
 resulted in the loss of the entire mudlib and months of work. One of the
 other admin's of Brazil and I then set out to regain our losses. The
 original plan was to build a MUD based on the TMI-2 mudlib (This was
 about 2 years ago) which we found to be inadequate for our purposes. We
 then tried the Nightmare v3.2 mudlib which was nice, but had strange
 features and wasn't easily modified without diving deep into the internals
 of the library. The problem was that a perspective mud creator with average
 wizard level LPC experience couldn't begin to build his/her own MUD without
 a good number of headaches doing some serious mudlib hacking. This is the
 kind of thing that restricts the creator's free flow of ideas and results
 in more and more MUDs with the exact same look & feel, Humpback Bridge,
 Footown, etc.  The descision was then made that we would write our own
 mudlib from the ground up so we could lay it out in a manner that made
 sense to us (and hopefully others). From here, what has come to be called
 ``UltraLib'' out of lack of a more snazzy name began to evolve.

<H3>The Birth Of UltraLib</H3>
 By the time a site was found to host the MUD (by this time it was nearly
 May of 1995), I was the only one willing to
 work on its creation. Thus for about 4 months I was running unchecked, the
 end result being that I produced a lot of legacy code that I would have
 to rewrite at a later time. Fortunately I have since found helpful
 individuals who have been willing to contribute to the project, and we
 have formed the beginnings of what will hopefully be a nice mudlib to
 work with. This mudlib was not originally intended to be publicly distributed,
 but after writing several commands and programs which accomplished
 the same results as others I had seen but with less and more elegant code,
 we decided that we should make our efforts available to others, so they
 would not have to waste their time reinventing the wheel.

<H3>The Future</H3>
 The plan as it stands right now is 3 fold: (1) to create a freely
 distributable mudlib that provides ease-of-use and logical layout, as
 well as too-cool features and snazzy looks which will serve as the platform
 for (2) a diverse 'playable' mud that will appeal to players of all sorts--\
 as there will be no restrictions (aside from QC) on wizards' realm ideas--\
 resulting in a kind of chaotic, yet very interesting world, from which some
 of the more interesting objects will be selected along with ideas and
 code contributed by the mudding communitiy at large to form the basis for
 (3) a series of theme-based ``add-on'' packages which will provide basic
 objects and tools from which to create realms.
