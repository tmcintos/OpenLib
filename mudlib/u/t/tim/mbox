hey we need to figure out how to get the driver to recognize the
word 'all'.  Like get 'all' and wear 'all'.  Any idea where we can
do that at?

I just had this idea and it is probably half-baked, but I'll let you
know before I forget it.
 
Maybe the bulletin boards should be the player's interface to a more
global news system (each board being an interface to a newsgroup).
Then wizards and the like could use newsreaders to interface to the
system and access any newsgroup. (not every group would have a bboard
for it of course)  The news would be handled by a daemon and could
then also easily interface with the intermud stuff.  The implementation
on IdeaExchange and other libs is very usenet-like...I think that is
probably a good way to go.
 
Well, let me know what you think about this.
