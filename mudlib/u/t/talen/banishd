Ok - an outline of a banish daemon. This system has to cater for two types
of people: those who have voluntarily banished themselves for a period of
time (if, for example, they have university exams on, and wish to enforce
some self control :-) ), and those that have been permanently banished by
the gods for whatever reason.

Functions:
BANISHD->banish(name, time)
- banishes the name. If time is given, the person is banished until that
time rolls around again (as given by time()). If not, they are assumed to
be banished _permanently_. (ie, if time = 0)

BANISHD->unban(name)
- what do you think this does? :-)

BANISHD->query_banished(name)
- returns -1 for a permanently banished character name, +ve number giving
the time that the character can return. If that time has since passed, tho,
it'll return 0. 0 = not banished.

Anybody think of anything else? I've put a preliminary version in the file
/u/t/talen/banish.c
