Sun Dec  3 23:14:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sun Dec  3 23:21:39 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry... was away
Sun Dec  3 23:21:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now it is going through someserious changes
Sun Dec  3 23:22:15 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my target is to have a web-based client by Q2 1996
Tue Dec  5 15:54:08 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ca va?
Tue Dec  5 15:55:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:alright, just curious how the 4.2.2 installs are going :)
Tue Dec  5 15:59:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:encre joe user
Tue Dec  5 15:59:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:<HEAD> is right
Tue Dec  5 16:07:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:be seeing you
Tue Dec  5 19:56:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we had a lot of muds on here this morning, what happened to them all?
Tue Dec  5 20:03:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:free cookies!!!!!!!!!!!
Tue Dec  5 20:07:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on intergossip, not on intercre :)
Tue Dec  5 20:09:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are virtual, so basically whatever kind you want
Tue Dec  5 20:09:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... no docs on poisoning I don't thibnk :)
Tue Dec  5 20:10:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on Doors? there are door docs
Tue Dec  5 20:10:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are docs on monsters now
Tue Dec  5 20:10:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks Raistlin :)
Tue Dec  5 20:12:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the doors worked fine
Tue Dec  5 20:12:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would bet Sinistrad tweaked them to break other systems
Tue Dec  5 20:12:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr2.2
Tue Dec  5 20:13:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not the way doors shio
Tue Dec  5 20:15:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, I think he made a change that breaks other systems
Tue Dec  5 20:15:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me tell you what happened...
Tue Dec  5 20:15:36 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on NM, id fields must be all lower case
Tue Dec  5 20:15:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you set your key id to mixed case
Tue Dec  5 20:16:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thus it never matched the id of anything
Tue Dec  5 20:16:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so Sinistrad went in and mucked with the id code
Tue Dec  5 20:16:22 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is wrong
Tue Dec  5 20:16:32 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you simply should not have had mixed case key id;s
Tue Dec  5 20:16:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not the problem,
Tue Dec  5 20:16:56 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is what you have in the key id field for doors
Tue Dec  5 20:17:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the door object
Tue Dec  5 20:19:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Selene, for all objects
Tue Dec  5 20:19:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetId() converts anything to lowe case
Tue Dec  5 20:19:53 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand the question Raistlin
Tue Dec  5 20:22:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, help in secure commands is not set up at this time
Tue Dec  5 20:23:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tail /secure/cmds/creator/call.c
Tue Dec  5 20:24:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because the expression 'black key' returns true for the door
Tue Dec  5 20:25:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I meant key
Tue Dec  5 20:25:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, actually, I can't answer that question
Tue Dec  5 20:25:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it *is* somehting you all did however
Tue Dec  5 20:25:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doors on Nightmare work fine
Tue Dec  5 20:26:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare IV even
Tue Dec  5 20:35:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Tue Dec  5 20:36:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how beautiful what is?
Tue Dec  5 20:37:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh *nod* I knew that would be a paradigm shift for people used to door coding
Tue Dec  5 20:38:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however, for people who have never coded on LPMuds before, a door *is* a separate object
Tue Dec  5 20:39:49 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Dec  5 20:41:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, thanks :)  you guys should also let Blitz and Rush on NM know, they have had a large part in this
Tue Dec  5 20:42:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:r2.2
Tue Dec  5 20:43:28 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:keep in mind, however, they reflect any changes that haveoccurred.... mostly they will work for r1, but in some cases they will be wrong for r1
Tue Dec  5 20:43:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rust, you know, I just now got that?
Tue Dec  5 20:45:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand the question
Tue Dec  5 20:46:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I still do not understand what you are asking :)
Tue Dec  5 20:46:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes :)
Wed Dec  6 15:06:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:: delimted
Wed Dec  6 15:08:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it wraps text according to the users screen width
Wed Dec  6 15:46:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, there will be
Wed Dec  6 15:47:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Dec  6 15:56:41 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:player or creator
Wed Dec  6 15:57:50 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek gets the credit for that
Wed Dec  6 16:01:45 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you want to add a neck?
Wed Dec  6 16:02:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the have the necklace protect the torso
Wed Dec  6 16:02:51 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, it should be armour type A_AMULET
Wed Dec  6 16:02:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what an amulet is
Wed Dec  6 16:03:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you have a necklace  does not require you to go adding necks
Wed Dec  6 16:03:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just type "wear amulet"
Wed Dec  6 16:03:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cat /include/armour_types.h
Wed Dec  6 16:04:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then there is a bug in someone's code
Wed Dec  6 16:07:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LIB_LIGHT
Wed Dec  6 16:08:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you need a reason to add a neck
Wed Dec  6 16:08:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not IMHO
Wed Dec  6 16:12:40 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Selene, we have already determined there is a bug in someone's code
Wed Dec  6 16:13:23 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it may be yours, I have no idea
Wed Dec  6 21:00:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:could people look at http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/API/object.html and tell me what you think about the documentation layout
Wed Dec  6 21:00:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:btw... that is NS 2.0 beta only
Wed Dec  6 21:04:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no comments?
Wed Dec  6 21:09:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, I suppose there is always the MS internet explorer :)
Wed Dec  6 21:15:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry, lost my link... did anyone manage to have a look?
Wed Dec  6 21:17:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Wed Dec  6 21:18:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Dec  6 21:23:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create filename room
Wed Dec  6 21:25:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cd to your home dir
Wed Dec  6 21:25:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and type 'create testroom.c room'
Thu Dec  7 18:51:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:workng on it :)
Thu Dec  7 18:51:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is /doc/build/Guilds
Thu Dec  7 18:51:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no examples though
Thu Dec  7 18:52:36 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm, nope, sorry, it does not yet exist
Thu Dec  7 18:55:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the guild object already allows leaders to make new members by simply issuing a command
Thu Dec  7 21:18:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:definitely comes after 137
Thu Dec  7 21:36:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he would not have a good thing to say about mother teresa
Thu Dec  7 21:37:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:here we go?
Thu Dec  7 21:38:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Thu Dec  7 21:53:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, at its creation
Thu Dec  7 21:53:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at no other time
Thu Dec  7 21:53:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what a virtual object is
Thu Dec  7 21:54:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Thu Dec  7 21:54:55 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorta, but not arbitrary
Thu Dec  7 21:55:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically, it will try to load a wierd fiel, like /realms/.descartes/cheese.t
Thu Dec  7 21:55:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that don't exist, so before it fails, it gives you a chance to clone an object and call it that
Fri Dec  8 21:32:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I see only 4 muds have not upgraded to IVr2.2 :)
Fri Dec  8 21:32:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is a persistance patch posted to the NM bug tracking system
Sat Dec  9 21:46:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I have been told
Sat Dec  9 22:10:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every mudlib on this line already has it working
Sun Dec 10 16:45:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because arrays are a pointer type
Sun Dec 10 16:45:57 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and all ({}) arrays point to the same array
Sun Dec 10 16:47:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:({0,}) may point to a different array from your other ({0,})
Sun Dec 10 17:20:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create filename room
Sun Dec 10 17:21:58 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the same as ed
Sun Dec 10 17:23:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetInventory()
Sun Dec 10 17:24:05 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do not use reset()
Sun Dec 10 17:24:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one sec
Sun Dec 10 17:27:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetInventory() is a more efficient manner of doing the trick
Sun Dec 10 17:28:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me put it another way, why would you mess with writing a reset() function and all that could go wrong when you can simply use SetInventory()?
Sun Dec 10 17:28:24 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't SetInventory() automatically takes care of that
Sun Dec 10 17:31:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reset() should rarely be used on NM muds any more... keep in mind objects are permanent
Sun Dec 10 17:31:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Novatron, though Kalinash is working on something better
Sun Dec 10 17:33:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is certainly a buggy system... are you sure you are connecting to mud port -10
Sun Dec 10 17:37:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you have a file ~novatron/adm/remote.c?
Sun Dec 10 17:38:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, that would do it :)
Sun Dec 10 17:41:14 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#include <lib.h>   inherit LIB_REMOTE;
Sun Dec 10 17:41:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only two lines for the file
Sun Dec 10 19:17:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rmdir
Sun Dec 10 20:06:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define not working
Sun Dec 10 20:07:31 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you did not set its meal type right
Sun Dec 10 20:09:34 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is this something you just coded or something someone had, then logged out, then logged on with?
Sun Dec 10 20:10:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did *you* try to dribk it?
Sun Dec 10 20:10:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cres can't drink or eat
Sun Dec 10 20:10:52 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why should they?
Sun Dec 10 20:11:08 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, cres are things that code
Sun Dec 10 20:11:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not players
Sun Dec 10 20:11:24 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:having heart beats and all that extra player overhead is a waste
Sun Dec 10 20:11:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cres do not have heart beats
Sun Dec 10 20:12:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's right... a mortal player is a much better gauge of play testing than is a cre
Sun Dec 10 20:12:10 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:interactive != has a heart beat
Sun Dec 10 20:13:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, in NM, interactive means inherits interactive.c
Sun Dec 10 20:13:21 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and interactive generally means responding to program output
Sun Dec 10 20:18:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what mud clients are for
Sun Dec 10 20:19:23 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a test on an objct not involved in a process is not a test
Sun Dec 10 20:21:21 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it very piossibly could be Jolt
Sun Dec 10 20:21:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:besides, it is a waste of resources
Sun Dec 10 20:22:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creators != players
Sun Dec 10 20:23:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Sun Dec 10 20:24:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sun Dec 10 20:25:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I imagine it will get through... Netscape == HTML now
Sun Dec 10 20:27:35 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all data members are protected
Sun Dec 10 20:27:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but can be made private
Sun Dec 10 20:28:20 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops, all data members are protected by default (but that is called public) and can be made private through the private keyword
Sun Dec 10 20:28:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:functions are public by default, but can be made protected (static) or private
Sun Dec 10 20:38:37 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand the quesiton
Sun Dec 10 20:40:57 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, you do SetItems() on the monster
Sun Dec 10 20:41:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should never describe one object through another object
Sun Dec 10 20:41:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to inherit LIB_ITEMS in the monster
Sun Dec 10 22:32:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/news/creator
Sun Dec 10 22:35:20 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Sun Dec 10 22:38:09 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is odd about that?
Sun Dec 10 22:38:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope, you are supposed to get them in thirds or halves or something
Sun Dec 10 22:40:33 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 recode it to do that #2 update the events daemon
Sun Dec 10 22:51:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:y localized in a functional
Sun Dec 10 22:54:08 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning if you have a local variable
Sun Dec 10 22:54:22 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and then you want it avilable to a functional to be evaluated later
Sun Dec 10 22:54:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to reference it in the functional as $(local_var)
Sun Dec 10 22:55:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the functional construct operator (: :) knows to evaluate the local variable now
Sun Dec 10 22:55:52 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the func... void foo() { function f; int x; x = 5; f = (: write($(x)) :);
Sun Dec 10 22:56:04 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:$(x) is set to 5
Sun Dec 10 22:56:20 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to understand functionals for it not be confusing
Sun Dec 10 22:57:43 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC is not C
Sun Dec 10 22:57:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC is an object oriented programming language
Sun Dec 10 22:58:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:C is a language to make geeks feel they are cool
Sun Dec 10 22:59:11 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just the while() for() stuff :)
Sun Dec 10 23:00:44 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:advanced is not out yet :)
Sun Dec 10 23:02:52 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call O'Reilly and Associates and ask them if they have any books on LPC
Sun Dec 10 23:04:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are in Boston
Sun Dec 10 23:09:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which NM pages? the doc pages? or the rest of it?
Sun Dec 10 23:12:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I agree Rassilon... that is why all the pages of NM will end up with a white bg
Mon Dec 11 19:19:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bing
Tue Dec 12 18:08:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:runtime really does not get you much
Tue Dec 12 18:08:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO
Tue Dec 12 18:17:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I think force does not exist yet
Tue Dec 12 18:18:26 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:this is not NM 3.2.2
Tue Dec 12 18:18:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Tue Dec 12 18:18:42 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in code it is simply ob->eventForce(cmd)
Tue Dec 12 18:19:37 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, force should be a verb
Tue Dec 12 18:19:45 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:but you could do it  as a command too
Tue Dec 12 18:19:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in which case you are right
Tue Dec 12 18:21:29 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:this is NM 3? or NM IV?
Tue Dec 12 18:22:01 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:they are important
Tue Dec 12 18:22:09 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you should not be intercepting the commands
Tue Dec 12 18:22:25 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in NM IV you handle it in eventReleaseObject()
Tue Dec 12 18:22:40 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and in NM 3 I think it is called release_objects()
Tue Dec 12 18:23:06 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:any time you define the same command in multiple places you are only creating bugs and user confusion
Tue Dec 12 18:24:16 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you can do SetTouch() in an object just like Listen, Smell, and Searcg
Tue Dec 12 18:25:02 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_TOUCH
Tue Dec 12 18:25:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:from inside move
Tue Dec 12 18:25:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:adding that action is bad
Tue Dec 12 18:25:56 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that is why it matters if you use NM IV
Tue Dec 12 18:26:39 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Tue Dec 12 18:26:49 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is an event that handles the go command
Tue Dec 12 18:27:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Tue Dec 12 18:27:25 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:err wrong Selene, I mean
Tue Dec 12 18:28:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:SetSmell() is LIB_SMELL, SetItems() is LIB_ITEMS, SetTouch() is LIB_TOUCH, etc
Tue Dec 12 18:28:49 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:move checks release_objects, therefore going checks it
Tue Dec 12 18:29:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:on NM 3? it does not
Tue Dec 12 18:29:56 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:eventGo() and eventEnter()
Tue Dec 12 18:30:18 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:which trigger the move event, which trigger the release object event, which triggers the receive object event
Tue Dec 12 18:30:26 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you override
Tue Dec 12 18:31:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not using a shadow, using normal lpc
Tue Dec 12 18:32:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, there is no reason at all for shadows here
Tue Dec 12 18:32:28 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:alter it just in the rooms you want it altered
Tue Dec 12 18:36:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it really depends, that is the right way to do it, it is not clumsy
Tue Dec 12 18:37:04 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:now that second idea is nasty
Tue Dec 12 18:37:40 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:because it is error prone
Tue Dec 12 18:37:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and LPC is not as slow as you think
Tue Dec 12 18:39:25 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LPC is not your problem
Tue Dec 12 18:54:29 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEMS
Tue Dec 12 18:55:01 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, that does work :)
Tue Dec 12 18:56:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there was documentation on this with the lib
Tue Dec 12 18:56:26 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there are other thigns you need to do
Tue Dec 12 18:56:36 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:which I do not remember off the top of my head
Tue Dec 12 19:01:01 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEMS
Tue Dec 12 19:01:09 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEMS has SetItems()
Tue Dec 12 19:01:21 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEM is  simple item,. like a wepaon
Tue Dec 12 19:02:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Tue Dec 12 19:14:35 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I am all alone in the supermarket, I can no longer shop happily
Tue Dec 12 19:15:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the clash :)
Tue Dec 12 22:20:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it converts a mixed case name into a unique id
Wed Dec 13 09:12:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thee
Wed Dec 13 09:12:56 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thou is second person subjective
Wed Dec 13 09:14:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, the name of the driver is LPMud 03.02.1@121
Wed Dec 13 09:14:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Amylaar is not the name of the driver
Wed Dec 13 13:52:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:TMI-2 is easier than NM???? when id you code a NM IV lib?
Wed Dec 13 13:55:33 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kalypso, like you have a clue
Wed Dec 13 13:57:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:clearly not NM IV
Wed Dec 13 13:57:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you are either and idiot or a liar :)
Wed Dec 13 13:58:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that tmi-2 design has been pretty much dismissed by most people, and people have moved on :)
Wed Dec 13 13:59:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why Kalypso? so if you misspell short you get an error you cannot debug?
Wed Dec 13 14:00:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, then you perfectly code a really slow and insecure lib :)
Wed Dec 13 15:09:08 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what's that?
Wed Dec 13 15:10:22 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean not allowed? target muds filter them
Wed Dec 13 15:11:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too bad
Wed Dec 13 15:12:09 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if a mud does nto want to see the codes, it should filter them out
Wed Dec 13 15:12:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never saw such intent, and I would never have agreed to such intent
Wed Dec 13 15:15:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the DW colour codes are stabdard
Wed Dec 13 15:15:53 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare will not stop sending them
Wed Dec 13 15:17:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am just stating that I do not believe that is right
Wed Dec 13 15:18:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fine, I will still send colours
Wed Dec 13 15:24:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the DW protocols are a defacto standard
Wed Dec 13 15:24:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:furthermore, when we started on this I3 stuff, it was my understanding they would be treated as a real standard for the intermud
Wed Dec 13 15:25:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every MudOS mudlib supports them
Wed Dec 13 15:25:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coding support for them is trivial
Wed Dec 13 15:26:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:even if it is just to filter them out
Wed Dec 13 15:26:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:other drivers and server types can use them
Wed Dec 13 15:29:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then they can deal with my % and ^ and FLASH and % and ^
Wed Dec 13 15:30:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if most muds on this line are not supporting that, then it serves no purpose to send that
Wed Dec 13 15:30:19 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it si communicating nothing
Wed Dec 13 15:30:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but as long as muds are, I am going to use it is a method of communication
Wed Dec 13 15:36:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who formatting is up to receiving muds now :)
Wed Dec 13 15:36:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it is communication as long as your target audience for the most part can understand it
Wed Dec 13 15:36:49 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it does not hurt anyone
Wed Dec 13 15:38:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they can easily filter it out, and it does not hamper usage by other systems
Wed Dec 13 15:39:28 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a non-argument
Wed Dec 13 15:39:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not faced with a Tower of Babel of colour protocols
Wed Dec 13 15:39:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have 1
Wed Dec 13 15:40:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, if a lot of Dikus show up not using this protocol, then it makes me using colour codes to communicate stupid since most people will not understand them, eh?
Wed Dec 13 15:41:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but as long as the vast majority do, I will continue to communicate using them
Wed Dec 13 15:44:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:looking at this mudlist I see only 2 that do not
Wed Dec 13 15:44:34 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Discworld supports it, Lima supports it, tmi-2 supports it
Wed Dec 13 15:44:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's not what Beek told me
Wed Dec 13 15:45:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh well, then I gather it must be your intention to support it
Wed Dec 13 15:46:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:either way, I don't much care :)
Wed Dec 13 15:47:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am thinking about users who by vast majority like colours
Wed Dec 13 15:48:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I see DB's point on that... he thinks that would become an impediment to Dikus and such joining
Wed Dec 13 15:50:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my argument is that prohibiting it does not further that cause
Wed Dec 13 15:50:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is definitely true :)
Wed Dec 13 15:52:24 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also... if Dikus and MOOs and MUSH'es were beating down the door to join I3, I would be willing to reconsider my stance
Wed Dec 13 15:52:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but the fact is that I3 right now and for the forseeable future is mostly LP, specifically MudOS
Wed Dec 13 15:54:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I for one would be willig to help
Wed Dec 13 15:59:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, I agree... though you may have a hard time defining what a player is for some MUD systems
Wed Dec 13 16:00:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depend son you rmudlib
Wed Dec 13 16:00:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes it does
Wed Dec 13 16:04:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think you think I argue about thinking you argue
Wed Dec 13 16:06:14 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, he hates strawberry
Wed Dec 13 16:06:22 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with a viciously bigoted mind
Wed Dec 13 16:11:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 you should not specify a limb for monster wielding
Wed Dec 13 16:11:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:keep in mind also some monster races may not even have wielding limbs.
Wed Dec 13 16:11:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:can a player wear the thing?
Wed Dec 13 16:14:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would indicate something about your monster is not right then
Wed Dec 13 16:15:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand what exactly is ot working...
Wed Dec 13 16:17:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right...
Wed Dec 13 16:17:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and when does it not work?
Wed Dec 13 16:23:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chocolate is the solution to all problems
Wed Dec 13 16:23:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hello
Wed Dec 13 16:23:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not know tmi-2
Wed Dec 13 16:41:17 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lars pensji C
Wed Dec 13 16:49:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetWander(x) randomly chooses a path
Wed Dec 13 18:15:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:here
Wed Dec 13 18:15:24 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to be one :)
Wed Dec 13 18:15:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IE is not a mudlib support site
Wed Dec 13 18:19:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want to teach, just let me know what sortof structure you need
Wed Dec 13 18:39:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?
Wed Dec 13 18:39:45 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so you can be an ass on one?
Wed Dec 13 18:39:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you figure if you just put up a dummy mud you can be a fuckwit?
Wed Dec 13 18:57:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:argument 1 to fp
Wed Dec 13 19:42:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who let out all these assholes?
Wed Dec 13 19:57:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the room doc
Wed Dec 13 20:03:57 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:RTFN
Wed Dec 13 20:04:01 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err RTFM
Wed Dec 13 20:55:55 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Misery, you are such a fuckhead
Wed Dec 13 20:56:05 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is not whether they make hb static
Wed Dec 13 20:56:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is assholes like you who just cause trouble
Wed Dec 13 20:56:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't drink coffee, I am naturally this fun to be with
Wed Dec 13 20:58:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whee!!! got who and finger gatewats back up for NM and IE :)(
Wed Dec 13 20:58:56 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayuh
Wed Dec 13 21:06:33 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know, they give me a woody too
Wed Dec 13 21:10:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be what nomask means
Wed Dec 13 21:11:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I would not think it beyond credibility that you simply don;t know what you are doing
Wed Dec 13 21:42:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:supposed to be this weekend
Wed Dec 13 21:42:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe the weekend after though
Wed Dec 13 21:42:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can put it off for those
Wed Dec 13 21:43:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want to try to make this the last release with feature additions
Wed Dec 13 22:02:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no reaosn on earth for it
Wed Dec 13 22:03:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, it works, but again, there is no reason to do it
Wed Dec 13 22:03:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use CreRemote
Wed Dec 13 23:00:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO, you are talking about some rather big differences there, I don't think you can find a BEST, justa best for you
Wed Dec 13 23:01:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:although, I would be interested in hearing how you evaluate each strength's and weaknesses
Wed Dec 13 23:01:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just cres
Wed Dec 13 23:02:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any thoughts right now?
Wed Dec 13 23:07:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what would you is Lima's strongest point?
Wed Dec 13 23:11:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:deal with it people
Wed Dec 13 23:12:19 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds like a personal problem
Wed Dec 13 23:16:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I plan to do something for menuing and administration
Wed Dec 13 23:16:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that will probably come with NM VI, which is intended to be a heavy UI release
Wed Dec 13 23:17:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:UI == user interface
Wed Dec 13 23:18:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does too
Wed Dec 13 23:19:09 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:admittedly, NM VI probably will not come out til next summer though
Wed Dec 13 23:19:19 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and no one on this line should much care about NM VI :)
Wed Dec 13 23:19:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone on this line using NM should stop worrying about upgrades once NM V is released
Wed Dec 13 23:19:51 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which mudlist? the mudlist command?
Wed Dec 13 23:21:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlist commands automatically removes and adds muds as they disconnect and connect from the I3
Thu Dec 14 07:25:32 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean undirected messages?
Thu Dec 14 07:27:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not using the any of the mudos messaging schemes, no... NM does messaging OO... ob->Pritn()
Thu Dec 14 07:27:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so you would intercept that
Thu Dec 14 07:27:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but catch_tell() is called only in things that are 'living'
Thu Dec 14 07:28:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the actual method is eventPrint() on NM
Thu Dec 14 07:34:05 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, NM may be switching ip #'s
Thu Dec 14 07:34:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this should improve its routing, as winternet seems to be having problems with the 199.* group
Thu Dec 14 07:34:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no :) not yet
Thu Dec 14 07:34:53 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is important to know, however, for router purposes
Thu Dec 14 07:35:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at that point it would e too late anyways :)
Thu Dec 14 07:36:36 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh
Thu Dec 14 07:56:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone put any thoght into intermud mail?
Thu Dec 14 07:59:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is a full protocol on the i3 spec?
Thu Dec 14 07:59:57 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is mail OOB?
Sun Dec 17 22:11:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and your point is Rot?
Sun Dec 17 22:12:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the next release is another alpha for NM V
Sun Dec 17 22:13:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the release number is IVr2.3
Sun Dec 17 22:13:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:login to Nightmare and see :)
Sun Dec 17 22:15:14 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depend son the driver situation
Sun Dec 17 22:15:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, probably, you will have to get the whole download :)
Sun Dec 17 22:16:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I don't keep track of those :)
Sun Dec 17 22:17:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whats.news?
Sun Dec 17 22:19:28 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I would bet I did not hear your question
Sun Dec 17 22:19:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in general, Rust is right, I do not listen to this channel even
Sun Dec 17 22:20:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NMSU? no idea, it is easy to change
Sun Dec 17 22:21:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and no, I do not keep a changelog
Sun Dec 17 22:21:32 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it does not fit my style of development
Sun Dec 17 22:24:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trust me, it is hard
Sun Dec 17 22:24:45 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are 3 ative mudlib developer sincluding myself all editing source
Sun Dec 17 22:26:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is that you are not supposed to make mudlib level changes until after NM V :)
Sun Dec 17 22:26:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I can think of a way to do changelogs or patch versions, I will do them
Sun Dec 17 22:26:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM V is mid-jan
Sun Dec 17 22:30:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:next weekend, I think
Sun Dec 17 22:31:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mid-jan... it is part of NM V
Sun Dec 17 22:37:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean with a rela one?
Sun Dec 17 23:24:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no :(
Sun Dec 17 23:33:19 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not sure what you are asking
Sun Dec 17 23:35:42 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in the event you are changing just the wander path at some point
Sun Dec 17 23:36:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in create(), you always are gonna use SetWander()
Sun Dec 17 23:37:22 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Sun Dec 17 23:37:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:SetWanderPath() only sets the path
Sun Dec 17 23:38:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:like if later you want to change the path but no other settings
Sun Dec 17 23:38:27 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:for example, you write a room that re-doirects wandering monster
Sun Dec 17 23:38:41 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you do not want to muck with their wander chance, etc
Mon Jan 15 22:56:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I do not understand what you are asking for MogwI
Mon Jan 15 22:58:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie :)
Tue Jan 16 07:54:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not releasing it until I take care of a couple of bugs
Tue Jan 16 07:54:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which probably means tonight
Tue Jan 16 07:54:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I will wait til this weekend if I have to
Tue Jan 16 08:01:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not yet
Sat Jan 20 19:28:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea, that's not what I do here :)
Sat Jan 20 19:31:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, then like the docs say, don't try until there are docs with NM V :)
Sat Jan 20 22:30:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you don;t change that mud name, pretty soon no one will see it
Sat Jan 20 22:38:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:PhoenixMud
Sat Jan 20 22:38:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though you should change really quick yourself :)
Sat Jan 20 23:25:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sat Jan 20 23:31:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are here :)
Sat Jan 20 23:32:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update /daemon/verbs.c
Sat Jan 20 23:32:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I probably used a preload.cfg from NM IVr2.1 on accident, and it is not preloading verbs.c
Sat Jan 20 23:56:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:why is that?
Sat Jan 20 23:57:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the verbs work fibne
Sat Jan 20 23:59:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you must have done something bizarre then
Sat Jan 20 23:59:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:or you are expecting it to do something it is not supposed to do
Sun Jan 21 00:02:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:one thing though, given that there are no rooms other than the start room with the mudlib, you can;t go much of anywhere
Sun Jan 21 01:54:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:grep SetTown /lib/*.c
Sun Jan 21 02:21:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:then change it
Sun Jan 21 02:24:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I told you to grep SetTown /lib/*.c
Sun Jan 21 02:24:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:better yet, grep for Praxis
Sun Jan 21 10:35:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah :)
Sun Jan 21 11:08:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:oops wrong line :)
Sun Jan 21 11:35:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:no gas!
Sun Jan 21 13:37:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:this is where I point out that the concept of a combat object is flawed :)
Sun Jan 21 13:37:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Nippe I am just making things up right now, to give a real answer, you have to look at the error causing it
Sun Jan 21 13:38:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:heart beats stop because an erro roccurred while they were executing
Sun Jan 21 13:38:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:/log/runtime is all runtime errors
Sun Jan 21 13:41:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that really does not fit the object model
Sun Jan 21 13:42:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should use a test char to test the game
Sun Jan 21 13:43:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i don;t understand what you are saying Raven
Sun Jan 21 14:08:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call fo->SetStat("whatever", stat_level, class) where class is a number between 1 anf 5, 1 being good 5 being bad
Sun Jan 21 14:12:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:several are involved
Sun Jan 21 14:14:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:there will be a full domain with NM V
Sun Jan 21 14:14:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:strength, coordination, agility
Sun Jan 21 18:34:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that would be impossible, since the lib has only been out a few months
Sun Jan 21 18:34:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not NM IV
Sun Jan 21 18:35:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the current lib is a new mudlib from scratch
Sun Jan 21 18:37:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use the one that most closeley matches what you are trying to do
Sun Jan 21 18:39:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, NM has that shit, dunno about others
Sun Jan 21 18:40:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope... guild skills and spells differ no more than class spells and skills
Sun Jan 21 18:42:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/lib/classes.c and /verbs/spells/*.c
Sun Jan 21 18:42:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:depend son what you do with them
Sun Jan 21 19:41:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you guys are gonna get your site banned from I3
Sun Jan 21 19:41:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this would be the first threat
Sun Jan 21 19:42:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but yes, it is a threat
Sun Jan 21 19:42:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayuh
Sun Jan 21 19:42:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are asking, then you are too stupid to understand the problem
Sun Jan 21 19:43:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don;t care what you think :)
Sun Jan 21 19:44:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so how about it? shut down the mud now or don't get on I3 under any name?
Sun Jan 21 19:45:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so be it
Sun Jan 21 19:49:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:takes a second to get rid of you
Sun Jan 21 19:54:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sun Jan 21 19:55:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like normal
Sun Jan 21 19:55:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM muds and Lima muds at least allow you to enter the name
Sun Jan 21 19:56:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like: 'tell memnoch@realms of the shaded boo'
Sun Jan 21 19:57:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, those dorks are off of here
Sun Jan 21 20:01:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to_int()
Sun Jan 21 20:01:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, 1 + "";
Sun Jan 21 20:02:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Sun Jan 21 20:08:42 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right :)
Sun Jan 21 20:41:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/lib/classes.c
Sun Jan 21 20:43:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:could be anythng... probably did not set a valid race
Sun Jan 21 20:43:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you really need to look at the error in the error log
Sun Jan 21 22:02:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is to start the technical aspect that two muds cannot have the same name on I3
Sun Jan 21 22:02:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then beyond that, as Skylight saidm it is rude
Sun Jan 21 22:02:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:given that the original phoenix has been around 5 years
Sun Jan 21 22:03:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Phoenix has built up a certain name capital
Sun Jan 21 22:03:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:originally, it waas an accident
Sun Jan 21 22:03:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but when someone else pointed it out to them, they took the attitude of so what
Sun Jan 21 22:04:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some dude named Iam
Sun Jan 21 22:04:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, he died 300 years ago
Sun Jan 21 22:05:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they were not faced with the shut down or be banned until after they basically  turned their noses to the fact their were using someone else's mud name
Sun Jan 21 22:07:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is one of the pre-requisites... that names do not condlict
Sun Jan 21 22:09:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just grab the files off of IE
Sun Jan 21 22:10:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those are more up to date than the I3 dist... I have not updated that to req-3
Sun Jan 21 22:10:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud.c services.c and services/*.c
Sun Jan 21 22:11:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok... debugmalloc and check_memory are defined... why don;t I have a check_memory() efun :(
Sun Jan 21 22:17:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don;t compile IVr2.3 :)
Sun Jan 21 22:19:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, if you are having a problem compiling the driver you should mail those problems to mudos-bgs@imagianry.com
Sun Jan 21 22:19:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many points for a free pizza?
Sun Jan 21 22:22:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you must have v21.5 or later
Mon Jan 22 18:11:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NOTICE: I3 will *probably* be going down for a short time tomorrow night while imaginary.com upgrades its server
Mon Jan 22 21:35:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sentients, not npc;s
Mon Jan 22 22:01:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one sec
Mon Jan 22 22:05:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can't :)
Mon Jan 22 22:05:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:started at v22a18
Mon Jan 22 22:06:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a bug
Mon Jan 22 22:06:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:none would
Mon Jan 22 22:06:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gotta dbx the core
Mon Jan 22 22:06:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Mon Jan 22 22:19:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which version of mudos?
Mon Jan 22 22:30:42 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LIB_SENTIENT
Mon Jan 22 22:31:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sentient inherits npc
Mon Jan 22 23:13:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, those bugs are fixed in v22a18
Mon Jan 22 23:13:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:but that is what IVr2.3 is for :)
Tue Jan 23 19:49:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no downtime tonight :) we are upgrading saturday :)
Tue Jan 23 19:51:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a sparc 5 upgrade board
Tue Jan 23 20:54:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:v22a18 slightly modified for solaris... added the D to help Beek tell the difference in bug reports
Wed Jan 24 21:00:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:vmstat
Thu Jan 25 22:49:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, they told you to shut up on intercre
Thu Jan 25 22:50:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to be pretty damn offensive to be told to shut up on here
Thu Jan 25 22:51:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh
Sat Jan 27 16:11:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, earth.imaginary.com should be right
Sat Jan 27 16:12:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:imaginary.com is working fine :) plus I have access to the imaginary hosts fiel now
Sat Jan 27 16:16:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does
Sat Jan 27 16:17:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your machine just has to recognize it
Sat Jan 27 16:17:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some machines cache host info, so it takes time to propogate changes
Sat Jan 27 16:17:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sat Jan 27 16:26:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rebooting this machine, I3 will go down a sec
Tue Jan 30 16:36:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry about all the problems :(
Tue Jan 30 16:37:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we got an upgrade cpu
Tue Jan 30 16:37:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it was bum
Tue Jan 30 16:41:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:changeover?
Tue Jan 30 16:41:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh thje new ip # :) *nod*
Wed Jan 31 19:24:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Wed Jan 31 20:05:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:1.0 will not work with 2.3
Wed Jan 31 20:05:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you need 2.0
Wed Jan 31 20:30:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no it makes it primaruy
Wed Jan 31 20:38:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:nope, it does not
Wed Jan 31 20:38:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and yes, NM 3 did use exp :)
Wed Jan 31 20:39:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Pinkfish has the first issue ready, Lassondra is reviewng it
Wed Jan 31 20:42:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I don';t know, perobably the new web server is messed up
Wed Jan 31 20:43:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:faq general
Wed Jan 31 20:52:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Wed Jan 31 20:59:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:j'existe!
Wed Jan 31 21:01:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp is such a cool thing, DUDE!
Wed Jan 31 21:02:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you use the skills, and they go up
Wed Jan 31 21:39:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:combat is slow for slow people
Wed Jan 31 21:39:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fast for fast people
Wed Jan 31 21:40:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only way to make it fast for everyone is to make everyone fast
Wed Jan 31 21:40:18 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and while you are at it, give them all 10000 hp :)
Wed Jan 31 21:41:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, it is based on your stats
Wed Jan 31 21:41:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and it is sup[posed to be sliggish for slow people
Wed Jan 31 21:42:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:basically
Wed Jan 31 21:43:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Jan 31 21:45:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:i am saying that f yuor goal is to make everyone an awesome player when they login, go ahead and give everyone a heart beat of 2
Wed Jan 31 21:47:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am telling you that you can do it, but that in doing so, you are messing with one of the ways in which people better themselves
Wed Jan 31 21:47:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:its your mud, do what you want :)
Wed Jan 31 21:49:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the place that says set_heart_beat()
Wed Jan 31 22:25:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:ueber alles
Wed Jan 31 22:32:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:hands out free cheese.
Wed Jan 31 22:34:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes I can do that :)
Wed Jan 31 22:37:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:minnesota is huge for fishing
Wed Jan 31 22:42:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:minneapolis is probably 300-400k, the twin cities are over a mil
Wed Jan 31 22:44:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:twin cities... minneapolis and st paul, plus about a few dozen smaller cities surrpunding them
Wed Jan 31 22:46:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool
Wed Jan 31 22:46:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smokers suck
Wed Jan 31 22:46:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to kill yourself, just don;t take me with you
Wed Jan 31 22:47:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:believe i or not, thre is a difference between a by-rpoduct of our technology that keeps us running and sucking on smoke for the fun of it
Wed Jan 31 22:49:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when was the last time someone spitted chweing gum n your face?
Wed Jan 31 22:50:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, so that makes smoking ok?
Wed Jan 31 22:51:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am saying that is kind of different, because people do not in the course of cheewing gum force it upon you
Wed Jan 31 22:51:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smokers by default force their smoking on others
Wed Jan 31 22:52:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:loadly smacking gum never killed anyone
Wed Jan 31 22:53:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dreldragon, you are a complete fool if you believe that :)
Wed Jan 31 22:53:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, a puff in the face can kill, and certainly makes people physically sick
Wed Jan 31 22:54:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smaking gum is just plain annoying
Wed Jan 31 22:55:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:happy cancer sticks to ya Drel :)
Wed Jan 31 22:56:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:stik you, you shitting fuck sack?
Wed Jan 31 22:56:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sex is about the only habit I have that i can think of
Thu Feb  1 18:45:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:15000 watts of data!
Thu Feb  1 18:53:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the one that comes with the lib, though Kal has a new beta coming out this weekend I think
Thu Feb  1 18:55:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why not?
Thu Feb  1 21:00:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any idea what the coldest temperature measured on earth is?
Thu Feb  1 21:01:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trying to fix that bug in code is a bad idea
Thu Feb  1 21:01:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has neveer gotten to absolute zero on earth
Thu Feb  1 21:02:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coldest air temperature
Thu Feb  1 21:02:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean the coldest known air temperature on earth
Thu Feb  1 21:02:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:labs is menaingless
Thu Feb  1 21:02:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ask a simple question and get a bunch o geek answers :)
Thu Feb  1 21:08:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said nature!
Fri Feb  2 12:32:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:have you worked with one before?
Fri Feb  2 12:32:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you might try crawling before you run
Fri Feb  2 12:33:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean you should code on one before you try starting one yourself
Fri Feb  2 12:34:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then do so on anothr mud like nightmare
Fri Feb  2 12:34:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we have no level requirement
Fri Feb  2 12:34:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nightmare.imaginary.com 1701 and ask lassondra
Fri Feb  2 12:35:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tell to lassondra until she zaps you
Fri Feb  2 12:37:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I jave not got intermud mail working yet :)
Fri Feb  2 14:06:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I2 was originally CD, yes

Fri Feb  2 14:07:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for charlmers computers club
Sun Feb  4 12:01:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on NM it is load_object()
Sun Feb  4 12:02:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as well as just about any other mudos mud
Sun Feb  4 12:03:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hio :)
Sun Feb  4 12:17:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who in particular?
Sun Feb  4 12:22:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I wrote virtual rooms for Nightmare IV, Pallando did them for 3
Sun Feb  4 12:22:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Pallando is around every now and then
Sun Feb  4 13:18:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Mon Feb  5 08:05:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare::
Mon Feb  5 08:07:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:ok, cept I am off to work :(
Mon Feb  5 11:35:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they need a head start just to keep up with the rest of the world
Mon Feb  5 11:42:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone comes to watch me mud wrestle with famous supermodels
Mon Feb  5 17:55:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ever heard of the alias command Leto>?
Mon Feb  5 17:58:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has that stuff
Mon Feb  5 17:58:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM just does not distribute its gateway objects
Mon Feb  5 17:59:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://nightmare.imaginary.com:1696/gateways/who
Mon Feb  5 18:00:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://nightmare.imaginary.com/:1696/gateways/mudlist
Mon Feb  5 18:02:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib ships with an http daemon
Mon Feb  5 18:02:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not ship with any pages, because I don't want a hundred other muds having pages that look just like NM LPMud
Mon Feb  5 18:03:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know :)
Mon Feb  5 18:03:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are cool pagees all over the net
Mon Feb  5 21:25:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:skinny puppy anyone?
Mon Feb  5 21:44:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:who are you?
Mon Feb  5 22:14:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you guys know parse_sentence() would return huge numbers?
Mon Feb  5 22:21:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:been round a long time
Mon Feb  5 22:32:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what about parse_sentence() returning nuinbers like 1234567
Mon Feb  5 22:32:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone experience that fun?
Mon Feb  5 22:33:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:v22a22
Mon Feb  5 22:46:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno that he would have changed the data type
Mon Feb  5 22:46:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also, the numbers are not consistent, and thus not indicative of that kind of mistake
Mon Feb  5 23:56:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there played with v22a21 or later?
Mon Feb  5 23:57:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you use the NLP stuff?
Mon Feb  5 23:57:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:parse_shit()
Mon Feb  5 23:58:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not that it is shit, it is cool :) just being mind numblingly cute
Mon Feb  5 23:58:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, the changes I got... I am having a problem parsing a particular situaiton
Mon Feb  5 23:59:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, lemme know how you end up handling this situation:
Mon Feb  5 23:59:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chest and bag in room
Mon Feb  5 23:59:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sword in bag, sword in chest
Tue Feb  6 00:00:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make "get sword from chest" get the sword from the chest, not return "which sword do you mean?"
Tue Feb  6 08:00:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ice on the road?
Wed Feb  7 22:26:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:the textbooks are being rewritten
Wed Feb  7 22:27:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:when the full rewrite is done, with the release of NM V
Wed Feb  7 22:41:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:actually, I think they started off very different, but Beek has had some taming effects on those differences :)
Wed Feb  7 22:42:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:also this MudOS parsing syste does force some design descisions on you
Wed Feb  7 22:42:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:who coded it for NM :)
Wed Feb  7 22:44:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I3?
Wed Feb  7 22:45:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I3 pre-dates Lima
Wed Feb  7 22:45:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:and the spec is not related to a mudlib
Wed Feb  7 22:46:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:no bragging necessary
Wed Feb  7 22:46:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:Rust I totally isagree with your view of I3 history
Wed Feb  7 22:47:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:Truilkan
Wed Feb  7 22:49:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I1 was an insane piece of shit
Wed Feb  7 22:49:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:yes
Wed Feb  7 22:52:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:err, actually it did get to around 90, that is when it got really nasty
Wed Feb  7 22:55:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:it already existed, but no one used it
Wed Feb  7 22:55:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:and it turned out to be buggy anyways
Wed Feb  7 23:04:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:get a real mudlib?
Wed Feb  7 23:06:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:wenn ich die rechte antworte haette wurde ich das euch geben
Wed Feb  7 23:06:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:would you like me to make up an answer?
Wed Feb  7 23:07:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:cause I don't have a clue other than for you to get a real mudlib
Wed Feb  7 23:07:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:amo mangeare spaghetti
Wed Feb  7 23:08:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I have been counting how many ways I know how to kill with just a touch
Wed Feb  7 23:08:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I reached 57 when you entered
Wed Feb  7 23:09:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:briseann na fear cloiche ans an sraad
Wed Feb  7 23:10:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:janet
Wed Feb  7 23:10:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:piss off misery
Wed Feb  7 23:13:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I based my life off of different strokes
Wed Feb  7 23:14:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:age, god help me if people think I am old
Wed Feb  7 23:14:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:my birthday is coming up though :)
Wed Feb  7 23:14:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:aquarians rock
Wed Feb  7 23:16:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam
Wed Feb  7 23:18:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:it started off as the place to code the database stuff for LPC
Wed Feb  7 23:18:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:now it is also doing the NM verb conversion
Wed Feb  7 23:20:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:Do you guys see this gif?
Wed Feb  7 23:20:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:go ahead Molochai,
Wed Feb  7 23:20:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:make my day
Wed Feb  7 23:32:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:that would be one way from me t start filtering your mud from my muds
Wed Feb  7 23:34:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:abortion abortion abortion abortion
Thu Feb  8 14:42:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rien de nouveau
Thu Feb  8 14:43:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with NM IV you don't, you use verbs
Thu Feb  8 14:44:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any verb is automatically added to everyone
Thu Feb  8 14:45:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no such things as command paths
Thu Feb  8 14:46:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ed is not a verb, it is a command
Thu Feb  8 14:46:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, all verbs are always available to everyone
Thu Feb  8 15:12:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:abortion abortion abortion abortion
Thu Feb  8 15:16:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the abortion section is already deemed unconstitutional
Thu Feb  8 15:17:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:outside of the few bizaare freedom of speech issues, the overall bill itself is extremely important
Thu Feb  8 15:18:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what on earth are you guys talking about with respect to wearing things?
Thu Feb  8 15:19:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wear isa verb also, not a command
Thu Feb  8 15:20:03 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't take NM/MudOS advice from amylaar people
Thu Feb  8 15:20:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare does not use add_action()
Thu Feb  8 15:21:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only reason support for it even exists is because NM LPmud has legacy areas
Thu Feb  8 15:21:32 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:override the event call
Thu Feb  8 15:22:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, override and extend it
Thu Feb  8 15:22:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as Beek said, you never copy code
Thu Feb  8 15:22:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are copying code, then you are failing miserably at code reuse
Thu Feb  8 15:23:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:override means write your own eventWear(), extending it means calling ::eventWear()
Thu Feb  8 22:55:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no doc on building fishing spots yet
Sat Feb 10 10:24:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Sat Feb 10 10:26:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:banning names at the command line is not working yet
Sat Feb 10 10:27:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to use the call command to call the banish daemon
Sat Feb 10 10:35:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as a rule I never tell people to edit .o files
Sat Feb 10 10:36:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Sat Feb 10 10:45:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at least on a logically distinct, could be physically the same room
Sat Feb 10 10:48:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not at the moment
Sat Feb 10 10:48:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:they are part of the plan for the final release
Sat Feb 10 10:49:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:err, you totally misunderstand
Sat Feb 10 10:49:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:training centers are not for raising skills
Sat Feb 10 10:50:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the are a suppliment to get new players started
Sat Feb 10 10:50:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:train skills
Sat Feb 10 10:51:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:nothing
Sat Feb 10 10:52:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:training rooms however are not designed to be where people train all the time
Sat Feb 10 10:52:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:they just get people started, let them customize a bit
Sat Feb 10 10:52:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:they are supposed to train skills by dong
Sat Feb 10 10:52:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:doing
Sat Feb 10 10:53:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, the faq
Sat Feb 10 10:53:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:training rooms are for anyone with training points
Sat Feb 10 10:54:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:training rooms are not needed
Sat Feb 10 11:37:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is just no one in their right mind is using tmi-2 :)
Sat Feb 10 11:38:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably the login object, but I certainly don;t know
Sat Feb 10 15:36:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if they are from my mud, I rid them
Sat Feb 10 15:38:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:filter that mud
Sat Feb 10 15:39:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:players should not have access to intermud chat lines
Sat Feb 10 15:39:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however, we give tell, rwho, mudlist, and finger support to plaers
Sun Feb 11 23:32:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:nope
Sun Feb 11 23:54:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, there is security to stop that
Sun Feb 11 23:57:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the grant commands
Sun Feb 11 23:58:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:oh yeah, but I forgot
Mon Feb 12 09:49:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:eventPrint() is not buggy :)
Mon Feb 12 09:50:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am replying to old channel talk
Mon Feb 12 09:55:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:it is being worked on
Mon Feb 12 13:18:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there using the parser stuff from v22a22?
Mon Feb 12 14:28:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and this surprises you?
Mon Feb 12 20:42:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:eventReceiveDamage() or eventHealDamage()
Mon Feb 12 20:42:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:look at /lib/body.c
Mon Feb 12 20:42:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it has all sorts of info
Mon Feb 12 20:44:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:kill mother fucking depeche mode
Mon Feb 12 20:46:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Mon Feb 12 20:46:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck that shit
Mon Feb 12 20:47:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the thing doing the damage
Mon Feb 12 20:48:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a bug in call
Mon Feb 12 20:52:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't bother with the current specs
Mon Feb 12 20:52:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is being redone in a more sane fashion
Mon Feb 12 20:53:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would you think that?
Mon Feb 12 21:08:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Mon Feb 12 21:10:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know where to find some useful java socket object examples?
Mon Feb 12 23:32:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's what you get with an alpha :)
Mon Feb 12 23:36:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you something bizarre to make yourself not an admin
Mon Feb 12 23:38:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:insufficient information I guess :)
Mon Feb 12 23:42:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably a security bug
Mon Feb 12 23:42:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, there is nothing wrong with your secure dir
Mon Feb 12 23:42:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just with the addguest command
Mon Feb 12 23:45:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means the object is loaded
Tue Feb 13 00:09:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the banish daemon I think
Tue Feb 13 01:05:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:time for me to sleep
Tue Feb 13 01:06:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever Misery
Tue Feb 13 01:06:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt you would know what the real problems are
Tue Feb 13 01:07:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the fact of the matter is you cannot get v22a22 to work with anything mroe than simple verbs
Tue Feb 13 01:07:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Misery is a moron Falcon
Tue Feb 13 01:11:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first, it takes days, not hours to get NM  verbs to properly fit the v22a22 verb paradigm
Tue Feb 13 01:11:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:second even if you do it right, it is impossible for certain verbs ever to work right with v22a22
Tue Feb 13 01:11:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because of a couple of major bugs in it
Tue Feb 13 01:12:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and what were those bugs you got rid of?
Tue Feb 13 01:12:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that was smart
Tue Feb 13 01:12:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 that is not fixing them
Tue Feb 13 01:12:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 that is actually breaking them
Tue Feb 13 01:13:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I actually could give a shit if you break your entire mud
Tue Feb 13 01:13:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whether something is used as a verb has no bearing on how often it is used
Tue Feb 13 01:14:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ohara: it is fixing it with a BFH
Tue Feb 13 01:14:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I dunno Misery, ask the people on this line I have helped
Tue Feb 13 01:14:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just with YOU would not use my lib
Tue Feb 13 01:15:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I certainly don;t with you on the people at Lima either
Tue Feb 13 01:15:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err wish
Tue Feb 13 01:16:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:may I ask what exactly the point of going through the hassle of upgrading to a driver that does not work was?
Tue Feb 13 01:18:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yet you disabled those new features? and also thought the bug fixzes were good even though it introduced worse bugs?
Tue Feb 13 01:18:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only new features are related to verbs
Tue Feb 13 01:21:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and OBS was that important you had to upgrade before you had a clue as to what you were doing?
Tue Feb 13 01:22:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek generally does not add even newer features before fixing the ones he has now
Tue Feb 13 01:22:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the disconnect in your rationalization process amazes me
Tue Feb 13 01:25:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, I am going to bed
Wed Feb 14 10:31:18 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what for?
Wed Feb 14 10:32:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that is a known bug in mudos v22a18
Wed Feb 14 10:32:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am rewriting the bug tracking ystem with a real dbms backend
Wed Feb 14 10:33:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:then you fucked up the master
Wed Feb 14 10:34:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:define won't let is
Wed Feb 14 10:35:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you know, if you tell me 'X is broken' all I can tell you is 'X must be broken'
Wed Feb 14 10:36:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and I told you that you can't update the master object with mudos v22a18
Wed Feb 14 10:41:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I know, that happened when I upgraded to solaris
Wed Feb 14 10:57:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not here
Wed Feb 14 10:58:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have way too many messages, you did not read the ones here
Wed Feb 14 11:49:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:gossip total fear
Wed Feb 14 11:50:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:netscape
Wed Feb 14 11:51:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what is wrong with it leto?
Wed Feb 14 11:52:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:it tells you if you have email
Wed Feb 14 11:52:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:tools of the geeks
Wed Feb 14 11:53:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:la la la la la, whine bitch and moan
