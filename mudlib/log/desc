Tue Jul 30 22:21:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does anyone have any questions before I go do real work?
Tue Jul 30 22:23:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp.imaginary.com
Tue Jul 30 22:23:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a string of 8192 is longer than you need to print
Tue Jul 30 22:24:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you do AddSave() saves a variable
Tue Jul 30 22:26:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Jul 30 22:26:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:static is for save_object(), NM barely uses save_object()
Tue Jul 30 22:27:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dbxwhere player
Tue Jul 30 23:02:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no... unfortunately, this problem with imaginary.com having to change its site has got me out of whack
Sat Aug 24 18:50:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Aug 24 18:53:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Aug 24 18:56:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:was there a question? :)
Sat Aug 24 19:23:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eh?
Sat Aug 24 21:51:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:in a beta? right :)

Sat Aug 24 22:43:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:yes, but you have a utility for setting it up
Mon Aug 26 20:34:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there a good MFC  programmer
Mon Aug 26 20:35:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you have the quyestion, you are not the answer :)
Mon Aug 26 20:41:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/cfg/read.cfg and write.cfg
Mon Aug 26 20:41:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know where the hell Kalinash is>
Mon Aug 26 20:48:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zakk: MFC, or Linux thingy?
Mon Aug 26 20:49:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, neither :)
Mon Aug 26 21:55:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many muds out there are running on windows 95 or NT right now?
Mon Aug 26 23:14:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any C++ coders out there?
Mon Aug 26 23:15:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is there a special way to declare C functions which are being called from inside C++ code?
Mon Aug 26 23:21:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that worked, thanks!
Mon Aug 26 23:26:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to capture that info from inside interface.c I think
Mon Aug 26 23:35:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:bingles!
Mon Aug 26 23:36:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:mudos running in a nice real window :)
Mon Aug 26 23:36:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:be very afraid :)
Mon Aug 26 23:37:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:well, right now it brings up an empty window
Wed Aug 28 00:18:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and like you sai, if that is the problem, you have big problems :)
Wed Aug 28 00:18:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no such file which file?
Wed Aug 28 00:19:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the makefile creates a cc.h
Wed Aug 28 00:20:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use windows!
Wed Aug 28 09:02:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:idald sucks
Wed Aug 28 09:03:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is none... but diald was always fucking up my routing
Wed Aug 28 09:06:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am using Windows NT now cause Linux bites so hard
Wed Aug 28 09:07:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yes Leto, I know how to use diald
Thu Aug 29 20:12:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wouldn't the world be a better place if everyone only used microsoft products?
Thu Aug 29 20:15:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tchnicians are meaningless
Thu Aug 29 20:15:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the orgs that make money use NT
Thu Aug 29 20:15:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they do not use Win95
Thu Aug 29 20:18:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I hate MS
Fri Aug 30 21:28:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the question?
Fri Aug 30 21:30:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetRead((: func :));
Fri Aug 30 21:30:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wel, actually, SetRead("step", (: func :));
Fri Aug 30 21:32:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:add_action() sucks
Fri Aug 30 21:32:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more specifically, it leads to playing syntax games rather than mudding
Fri Aug 30 21:32:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:TMI-2 is filled with lots of old, outdated features
Fri Aug 30 21:39:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you convert a FAT file system to NTFS?
Fri Aug 30 21:40:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in Windows NT, I want to create my FAT drives to NTFS
Sat Aug 31 12:32:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:woo woo!!! no more config file!
Sat Aug 31 12:33:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:no more config file
Sat Aug 31 12:34:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 95:config data now stored in windows registry
Sat Aug 31 12:37:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there use MFC?
Sat Aug 31 12:38:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@WinMud 95:microsoft foundation classes
Sat Aug 31 12:38:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@WinMud 95:like a mudlib for C++
Sat Aug 31 13:15:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should not put punctuation or capitalization in items
Sat Aug 31 13:16:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people are using it to identify things, you do not wat to make them have toworry about cae
Sat Aug 31 13:16:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should call it blahs step
Sat Aug 31 13:17:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea :)
Sat Aug 31 13:19:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know how to add text to a CEditView window?
Sat Aug 31 13:21:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use the SetWield() method
Sat Aug 31 16:05:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not every conceivabkle thing on earth is done via SetShit()
Sat Aug 31 16:06:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are using NM and you are using add_action(), you are doing it wrong
Sat Aug 31 16:08:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hooks?
Sat Aug 31 16:11:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:functions
Sat Aug 31 16:13:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:have it respond to the drikn verb
Sat Aug 31 16:13:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right, because you did not specify something to happen when people try to drink
Sat Aug 31 16:15:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would that make a difference? :)
Sat Aug 31 16:16:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can have any number of functions in an object named anything you like
Sat Aug 31 16:16:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if nothing is told to call them, it is no good
Sat Aug 31 16:17:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't override it, you make it respond to the drinking verb
Sat Aug 31 16:17:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins/Parser
Sat Aug 31 16:27:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean?
Sat Aug 31 16:31:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the room is the object
Sat Aug 31 16:31:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your room simply needs respond to the drink verb
Sat Aug 31 16:33:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anything will respond that way
Sat Aug 31 16:34:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not say make it a real item, I said make the room repond like you want it to using the stuff on that web page
Sat Aug 31 17:54:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Aug 31 17:55:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make the room respond to the drink verb as outlined in gttp://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins/Parser
Sat Aug 31 18:34:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:quake.imaginary.com!
Sat Aug 31 18:36:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayup
Sat Aug 31 18:46:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:300 ms?
Sat Aug 31 18:46:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm, where are you?
Sat Aug 31 23:14:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, on NM all players are virtual objects
Sat Aug 31 23:16:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it reallay depends... it is more of a convenience thing at that level...
Sat Aug 31 23:16:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at another level, however, it can allow you to create a meta scripting language
Sat Aug 31 23:43:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there know how to start up netscape to open to a specific page?
Sat Aug 31 23:43:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:from the command line?
Sat Aug 31 23:44:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know anything about OLE?
Sat Aug 31 23:45:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope
Sat Aug 31 23:45:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:perhaps if you have it come up in the browser window by default
Sat Aug 31 23:45:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not for me... I have it come up to mail
Sat Aug 31 23:45:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:windows
Sun Sep  1 00:51:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you say that Satan?
Sun Sep  1 00:51:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do I allow a function in a .c file call a function in a .cpp file?
Sun Sep  1 00:52:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have the C++ function declared void __cdecl send_message(char *msg)
Sun Sep  1 00:52:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and prototyped as extern in the C file
Sun Sep  1 00:52:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I get a bad link while linking
Sun Sep  1 00:54:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is the last thing stopping me from getting the new mudoswin out the door :(
Sun Sep  1 00:55:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no clue... I have never done this before :)
Sun Sep  1 00:57:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning?
Sun Sep  1 00:59:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any idea how to call functions in C++ files from ones in C files??? :(
Sun Sep  1 01:00:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie :)
Sun Sep  1 01:02:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no variation of that is correct
Sun Sep  1 01:04:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:VC++
Sun Sep  1 01:05:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shyeah!
Sun Sep  1 01:51:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know in MVC++ how to associate an icon wih a window?
Sun Sep  1 12:08:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Sep  1 12:09:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't use SetHealthPoints() to change a player's data... that exists only to initially set NPC HP's
Sun Sep  1 12:13:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lessons on the parser?
Sun Sep  1 12:14:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am pretty darn certain such lessons are unlikely ;)
Sun Sep  1 12:15:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for non-actual objects?
Sun Sep  1 12:15:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everything on a mud is an object
Sun Sep  1 12:17:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the room is the fountain
Sun Sep  1 12:18:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not say create a separate fountain object
Sun Sep  1 12:18:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said the room is the fountain object
Sun Sep  1 12:19:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why is treating the room as a fountain any different from creating a fountain>?
Sun Sep  1 12:21:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some event involving damage
Sun Sep  1 12:22:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand what is not working for you in a room that works in an object
Sun Sep  1 12:27:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is what is Blitz said which happens to be in the document
Sun Sep  1 12:29:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is hard about what blitz said? :)
Sun Sep  1 12:30:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you aactually need a can_drink_obj_from_obj() and a direct_drink_obj_from_obj in the room, and the room hasd to have items for fountain and water
Sun Sep  1 12:30:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it also has to have indirect_drink_obj_from_obj()
Sun Sep  1 12:30:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Dragon, for the third time, it is an event like eventDanage() or something like that
Sun Sep  1 12:31:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Angus: perhaps you should try before you dismiss it
Sun Sep  1 12:31:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grep /lib/body.c for even and Damage
Sun Sep  1 12:33:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Sun Sep  1 12:33:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they all follow a format
Sun Sep  1 13:53:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:easier than installing netscape!
Sun Sep  1 13:55:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:wonder about what?
Sun Sep  1 13:57:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:newe release of mudos for windows
Sun Sep  1 13:57:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:among other things
Sun Sep  1 13:59:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:no
Sun Sep  1 14:00:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:and this one offers a lot of win95 specific stuff
Sun Sep  1 14:01:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:like a configuration dialog box
Sun Sep  1 14:01:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Windows Mud:installshield installation
Sun Sep  1 14:15:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can now pick up an easy to install mudos+nightmare at ftp.imaginary.com for Windows NT and Windows 95 :)
Sun Sep  1 14:16:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Sep  1 14:17:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Visual C++
Sun Sep  1 16:45:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:min for a mud is T1
Sun Sep  1 16:46:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:128k is not enough to shield you from one person surfing the web
Sun Sep  1 16:47:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and a dedicated 128k is more expensive than a T1 in many cases
Sun Sep  1 16:47:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:$70 dedicated?
Sun Sep  1 16:47:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the ISP allows 2 B channel dedicated access?
Sun Sep  1 16:48:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not true at all Anguys
Sun Sep  1 16:49:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dedicated single channel access phone company plus ISP here is $380
Sun Sep  1 16:49:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I move to CA, I will get a T1 for $495
Sun Sep  1 16:50:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ISP charges $200/month for single B channel ISDN dedicated service
Sun Sep  1 16:50:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:neither is a 28.8 angus
Sun Sep  1 16:51:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you can';t run a mud or a LAN off a 28.8
Sun Sep  1 16:51:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most colleges link their dorms now
Sun Sep  1 16:52:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not necessarily angus
Sun Sep  1 16:52:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if the network is saturated, it is saturated for all users
Sun Sep  1 16:52:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:28.8 is not sufficient for a mud
Sun Sep  1 16:52:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fun mud :)
Sun Sep  1 16:53:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:certainly not a fun mud
Sun Sep  1 16:54:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:28.8 is not enough to surf the web
Sun Sep  1 16:54:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:much less surf the web AND run a game
Sun Sep  1 16:55:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean malloc does not work?
Sun Sep  1 16:55:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can run a mud on a 300 bps modem
Sun Sep  1 16:55:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nothing hap[pens on any NM mud
Sun Sep  1 16:57:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:get the new release
Sun Sep  1 16:57:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:0.5.0
Sun Sep  1 16:57:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does ls /lib work?
Sun Sep  1 16:58:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oki, oh well, I will look into it later
Sun Sep  1 16:58:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not bogus angus... this comes from a hell of a lot of experience running kuds on different networks
Sun Sep  1 16:58:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh well, I am gone :) see ya later :)
Sun Sep  1 19:37:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not have the driver source with it
Sun Sep  1 19:39:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Sun Sep  1 19:40:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I also wrote it to be easy to use
Sun Sep  1 19:41:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds like a personal problem
Sun Sep  1 19:41:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM is the fastest lib out there
Sun Sep  1 19:41:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno about in comparison to Lima actually, but Lima does not actually do much
Sun Sep  1 19:42:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is difficult...
Sun Sep  1 19:42:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you gage similar tasks
Sun Sep  1 19:42:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but even that can be deceiving, cause NM tends to be doing a lot more than say TMI-2
Sun Sep  1 19:42:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM still comes out faster anyways
Sun Sep  1 19:43:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, most languages these days use mixed case
Sun Sep  1 19:43:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as part of there naming conventions
Sun Sep  1 19:43:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:C++, Java, SmallTalk, Delphi, etc
Sun Sep  1 19:44:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, the point is a consisteent, easy to read naming system
Sun Sep  1 19:44:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:something hard to come by in mudlibs
Sun Sep  1 19:44:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whether that is mixed case or not makes no difference
Sun Sep  1 19:46:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, it is hard to cpmpare that among the various mudlibs
Sun Sep  1 19:46:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:except to say that Discworld is tremendously wasteful
Sun Sep  1 19:46:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM loads a lot of shit up front
Sun Sep  1 19:47:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so its boot time and boot memory are going to be higher than other muds
Sun Sep  1 19:47:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the theory is that a long time between reboots is better than a lot of intermittant lag the first 15 minutes
Sun Sep  1 19:47:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you could go the other way
Sun Sep  1 19:48:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just not something useful for comparing
Sun Sep  1 19:48:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the best way to phrase the question is: is NM using more reosurces than are really required for the functionality it is providing, and do I need that functionality?
Sun Sep  1 20:07:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:better for what?
Sun Sep  1 20:08:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it really depends
Sun Sep  1 20:10:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a class is useful when you have a finite, known association of data
Sun Sep  1 20:10:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not nice memory-wise, but faster access
Sun Sep  1 20:10:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the lookup time on a class attribute is much faster than an array element
Sun Sep  1 20:10:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or a mapping element
Sun Sep  1 20:11:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but if you do not know what your keys will be ahead of time, you cannot use a class
Sun Sep  1 20:11:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if you do not have key values, then you want to use an array
Mon Sep  2 16:05:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do youy have intermud3???????
Mon Sep  2 16:05:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:might as well call me on the phone and ask if I have a telephone
Mon Sep  2 16:06:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or ask if anuyone here has internet access :)
Tue Sep  3 16:44:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:encre
Tue Sep  3 16:56:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:note very hard to get mudos for win32 to work :)
Tue Sep  3 16:57:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Sep  3 16:59:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt it, that behaviour is intentional
Tue Sep  3 17:00:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the speed is a very good reason
Tue Sep  3 17:00:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but also, otherwise, MudOS has no way of knowing which are tokens and which are not
Tue Sep  3 17:01:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should not be sticking in codes that are not codes
Tue Sep  3 17:02:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create a default entry
Tue Sep  3 17:02:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does not support every term type under the sun... if it does not know it, it ignores all the codes
Tue Sep  3 17:03:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have something that interprets termcap into the mudos system
Tue Sep  3 17:04:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that creates the default entries
Tue Sep  3 17:04:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:default_mapping + termcap_mapping = real_mapping
Tue Sep  3 17:05:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some, but you would lose a lot more by doing it
Tue Sep  3 17:07:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably you do not have permission to edit that file
Tue Sep  3 17:08:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/cfg/read.cfg and /secure/cfg/write.cfg
Tue Sep  3 17:11:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what happens when you try to shutdown?
Tue Sep  3 17:12:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you edit that file?
Tue Sep  3 17:13:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one thing I do know, the shutdown command works :)
Tue Sep  3 17:14:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is this NT or 95?
Tue Sep  3 17:45:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:quake.imaginary.com
Tue Sep  3 17:58:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone familiar with microsoft foundation classes?
Tue Sep  3 22:29:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nothing
Wed Sep  4 08:21:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you read the thng that came with the lib that says the docs are on the web?
Wed Sep  4 12:21:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Wed Sep  4 12:21:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:(: call_other, ob, method :)
Wed Sep  4 12:24:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no new set until v22
Wed Sep  4 13:00:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this line is for code questions
Wed Sep  4 13:02:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are theonly one on this line
Wed Sep  4 23:12:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:no more... it is now real...
Wed Sep  4 23:12:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:this mud is compiled in C++
Wed Sep  4 23:12:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:only a fraction so far is objects
Wed Sep  4 23:13:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:but all of it runs as C++
Wed Sep  4 23:13:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:fast?
Wed Sep  4 23:13:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:converting MudOS to C++ was a pain in the ass
Wed Sep  4 23:13:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:you would not believe the "try", "catch", and "new" variables for starters :)
Wed Sep  4 23:14:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:I am not going to OO everything
Wed Sep  4 23:14:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:just what is useful to me to have OO
Wed Sep  4 23:14:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:plus I can't write a lexer
Wed Sep  4 23:14:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:so I need that :)
Wed Sep  4 23:14:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:if I start from scratch, it will be in Java
Wed Sep  4 23:14:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:corrects himself to say "when"
Wed Sep  4 23:15:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:of all the code in MudOS,, Blackthorn;s has to be the ugliest
Wed Sep  4 23:15:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:no
Wed Sep  4 23:15:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:all mudos is is an LPC language parser
Wed Sep  4 23:16:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:java already has a Java parser
Wed Sep  4 23:17:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:fails to see what is scarey about that...
Wed Sep  4 23:19:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:what is wrong with Java? :)
Thu Sep  5 01:42:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:uh, we're like, closed or something
Thu Sep  5 18:07:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dead Souls

Thu Sep  5 18:18:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who stole what?
Thu Sep  5 18:25:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:stealing code is serious...
Thu Sep  5 18:25:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unfortunately all we have is bizarre accusations so far
Thu Sep  5 18:26:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is very serious
Thu Sep  5 18:26:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:stealing is stealing
Thu Sep  5 19:37:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know how to initialize static attributesin C++?
Thu Sep  5 19:38:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Thu Sep  5 19:39:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in java, you have a static constructor
Thu Sep  5 19:39:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no clue what C++ has
Thu Sep  5 19:40:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not that
Thu Sep  5 19:40:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want a static constructor so I can initialize my static vars before any method ever gets called
Thu Sep  5 19:41:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Sep  5 19:41:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is illegal in C++
Thu Sep  5 19:41:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the normal constructor is an object constructor
Thu Sep  5 19:42:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh... I see what you are saying Beek...

Thu Sep  5 22:22:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the question?
Thu Sep  5 22:25:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/lib/Nightmare
Thu Sep  5 22:27:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:remove the lib part
Thu Sep  5 22:28:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:help admin commands
Thu Sep  5 22:31:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the help command is screwey for the windows release of NM
Thu Sep  5 22:59:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:MFC would not know a goddamn dependency if it mattered to their life
Fri Sep  6 14:08:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you have anything better to do than be a total rude jerk on this line?
Fri Sep  6 14:10:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you have such a hard time agreeing with me, why are you using my mudlib?
Fri Sep  6 14:12:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using the mudlib means you clearly agree about something
Fri Sep  6 14:14:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hating something has nothing to do with agreement
Fri Sep  6 14:14:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not at all true :)
Fri Sep  6 14:25:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any idea why a gethostbyaddr would keep throwing no data errors?
Fri Sep  6 14:26:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which name map?
Fri Sep  6 14:27:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a DNS thing
Fri Sep  6 14:28:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am asking gethostbyname("my_ip_num",4, PF_INET);
Fri Sep  6 14:28:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:returning null, and getting WSANO_DATA
Fri Sep  6 14:31:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you say anything...
Fri Sep  6 14:31:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just froze
Fri Sep  6 14:32:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it always happens
Fri Sep  6 14:32:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never get a hostent back
Fri Sep  6 14:33:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, so far I have tried only a single machine
Fri Sep  6 14:36:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the 4 means itis a 4 byte address
Fri Sep  6 14:38:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does it for localhost too
Fri Sep  6 14:39:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intercre "The length of the address, which must be 4 for PF_INET addresses.
Fri Sep  6 14:45:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because the always correct MS documents say so :)
Fri Sep  6 14:47:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tried gethostbyaddr("206.11.201.20", sizeof("206.11.201.20"), AF_INET)... still no work
Fri Sep  6 14:47:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:had no other thing to try...
Fri Sep  6 14:48:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and explanations of WSANO_DATA re lacking
Fri Sep  6 14:49:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea how to snoop a socket in win95
Fri Sep  6 14:51:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is there
Fri Sep  6 14:52:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:WSANO_DATA	Valid name, no data record of requested type.
Fri Sep  6 14:53:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on what else?
Fri Sep  6 14:53:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yup (it would not compile otherwise :))
Fri Sep  6 15:00:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:seems to happen on a UNIX machine too
Fri Sep  6 15:04:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would not be here if it were not :)
Fri Sep  6 15:13:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Fri Sep  6 15:14:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fucking cool... got it to work
Fri Sep  6 15:14:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, I am using threads in several places in the win32 driver
Fri Sep  6 15:14:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the addr server construct is actually rather insane IMHO
Fri Sep  6 15:15:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I understand the reasons behind it :) I just don;t like it
Fri Sep  6 15:15:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:well, I just did it some other way :)
Fri Sep  6 15:15:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:I actually care quite a bit, the addr server works for UNIX less than it does work
Fri Sep  6 15:16:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:and additionally, the windows crowd won;t be able to deal with a addr sercer
Fri Sep  6 15:16:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:under UNIX I do cause the addr server is always screwey :)
Fri Sep  6 15:18:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:the cool thing about C++  is that you get reall arrays and mappings to code with
Fri Sep  6 15:18:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:rather than bizarre linked lists and memory reallocation
Fri Sep  6 15:54:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:windows will become the ideal mud environment!
Fri Sep  6 15:56:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hey, when you can configureusing a dialog box and get logging info to a main console...
Fri Sep  6 15:56:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:multi-threading, installshield...
Fri Sep  6 16:02:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Win95 Test:heh hehh heh heh hehh
Fri Sep  6 16:05:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:windows works fine
Fri Sep  6 22:53:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fucking lousy bastards allowing spam email

Sat Sep  7 15:03:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Gandhi is basically bullshitting you
Sat Sep  7 15:03:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is a C based ftpd
Sat Sep  7 15:04:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone else receive junk email frominternet marketing about email worlks 3.1?
Sat Sep  7 15:04:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:same place you get anything else for NM
Sat Sep  7 15:05:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh well, if you do I put toegther a nice reverse spam email bomb package for them if anyone else wants to share in the fun ;)
Sat Sep  7 18:55:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:%%^^BOLD%%^^

Sat Sep  7 18:57:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't fucking send ANSI over intermud
Sat Sep  7 18:57:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should never ever send raw ansi to users under ANY circumstances
Sat Sep  7 18:59:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bah, testing on intergossip to see if it works for you is never a problem :)
Sun Sep  8 00:55:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam
Sun Sep  8 00:58:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use a wander function
Sun Sep  8 00:58:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetWander((: func :)) or something
Sun Sep  8 00:59:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are hppy
Sun Sep  8 00:59:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, in the function you test to see if they are moving to one of your rooms
Sun Sep  8 00:59:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why does it have to be random?
Sun Sep  8 01:00:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:randomness in a confined area gets you nothing over a set path
Sun Sep  8 01:01:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look silly to whom?
Sun Sep  8 01:01:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a player who needs to get a life cause he is following the ducks around?
Sun Sep  8 01:02:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:really, no one would even notice that they were following a set path if you did it right
Sun Sep  8 01:03:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:randomly generate the path each tme a duck is loaded
Sun Sep  8 01:04:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:another possibility....
Sun Sep  8 01:04:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make it so the only way out of the pond is to climb out or something...
Sun Sep  8 01:04:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a NPC cannot randomly climb
Sun Sep  8 01:05:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the advantage to letting the monster randomly wander is that it never enters unloaded rooms
Sun Sep  8 01:05:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it always uses room exits/enters to determine where to go
Sun Sep  8 01:06:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did he say what I thought I heard him say? :)
Sun Sep  8 01:06:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok... I must be losing my eyesight
Sun Sep  8 01:08:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Whizkid: never never never never never use add_action
Sun Sep  8 01:08:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok... anyone who mentions add_action and Nightmare or Lima in the same sentence
Sun Sep  8 01:09:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Whizkid, use your verbs
Sun Sep  8 01:09:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in this case, it is overkill to extend an event just for duck interception
Sun Sep  8 01:10:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:instead, just make the edge of the pond something you clinmb out of (i.e. something that responds to the climb verb)
Sun Sep  8 01:10:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only advantage of what I am saying over what Nippie suggests is that your ducks won't load any unloaded rooms
Sun Sep  8 01:11:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:saves ram, takes more coding
Sun Sep  8 01:20:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that problem cannot exist
Sun Sep  8 01:20:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in order for the player to get there, adjacent rooms have to have been loaded
Sun Sep  8 01:21:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and SetCommand() works fine as far as I know
Sun Sep  8 01:22:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that is something you need to consider... have them wimpy at a high percentage
Sun Sep  8 01:22:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Sun Sep  8 01:23:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you too darklord :)
Sun Sep  8 01:24:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I3 is basically ready...
Sun Sep  8 01:24:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the  problem is I have to add all the races
Sun Sep  8 01:24:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err r3
Sun Sep  8 01:25:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:adding the dozens of races (monster and player) is a tedious task
Sun Sep  8 01:36:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not driver related
Sun Sep  8 01:41:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I really do not know.. i forgot how climb.c works
Sun Sep  8 01:42:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you make them respond to the triggered events
Sun Sep  8 02:11:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my beavis and butthead desktop theme says "You dumbass" when any C++ program fails to compile :)
Sun Sep  8 02:22:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, no, just heh heh heh heh

Sun Sep  8 03:18:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't port mudlibs
Sun Sep  8 03:37:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:while() means evaluate what is in the loop, if true, execute the block then come back up to the while() thing and evaluate again
Sun Sep  8 03:37:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:x-- means return the value of x, then subtract 1
Sun Sep  8 03:38:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whereas --x would mean subtract 1 from x then return the value
Sun Sep  8 03:38:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sun Sep  8 03:40:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:J'anus, that loop executes 1 time
Sun Sep  8 03:43:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not better to pre-declare :)
Sun Sep  8 03:44:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it makes no difference whatsoever :)
Sun Sep  8 03:44:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is LPC
Sun Sep  8 03:44:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why apply a problem for C compilers to LPC?
Sun Sep  8 03:45:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Java
Sun Sep  8 03:47:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java is a good language, but more important, it contains the potential to free us from Microsoft
Sun Sep  8 03:48:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:command to create a monster?
Sun Sep  8 03:49:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:completely portable, the OS no longer matters
Sun Sep  8 03:50:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean you have heard that one before?
Sun Sep  8 03:50:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is binary portable, write once, compile once, run anywhere
Sun Sep  8 03:50:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not C-like portability, it is LPC-like portability
Sun Sep  8 03:51:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC runs on any machine with a driver
Sun Sep  8 03:51:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:similarly, Java runs on any machine with a driver
Sun Sep  8 03:51:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cept Java calls the driver a virtual machine
Sun Sep  8 03:52:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what'st that got to do with anything?
Sun Sep  8 03:52:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:text files are not binary portable
Sun Sep  8 03:52:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since #1 text files are the opposite of binary
Sun Sep  8 03:53:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and thus the contents mean different things on different machines
Sun Sep  8 03:53:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ascii is text
Sun Sep  8 03:54:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is, you write a java program once, and you only compile it once
Sun Sep  8 03:55:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:after that, it runs on any machine in the world
Sun Sep  8 03:55:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who cares how far it is from the kernel?
Sun Sep  8 03:55:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Sun Sep  8 03:55:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since in some cases Java is the kernel
Sun Sep  8 03:55:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, soon, in most cases
Sun Sep  8 03:56:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope
Sun Sep  8 03:56:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java is being built into all major operating systems
Sun Sep  8 03:57:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, in some cases, Java is the operating system
Sun Sep  8 03:57:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a Java binary thus is executing right on top of the kernel
Sun Sep  8 03:57:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Dragon
Sun Sep  8 03:57:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is parrt of the next release of the OS, and part of NT 4
Sun Sep  8 03:58:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and part of OS/2
Sun Sep  8 04:00:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sun Sep  8 04:01:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I am an IT person and I think it has the potential to be revolutionary
Sun Sep  8 04:10:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the docs are right
Sun Sep  8 04:11:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call_out((: func :), time, arg1, arg2)
Sun Sep  8 04:11:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, try this...
Sun Sep  8 04:13:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:night all :)
Sun Sep  8 12:32:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, ansi gets wrapped with terminal_colour()
Sun Sep  8 12:34:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use the eval command and see
Sun Sep  8 12:52:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would you change the chars terminal colour recognizes?
Sun Sep  8 12:53:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:replace_string(str, sprintf("%c", 13), "char")
Sun Sep  8 12:53:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I was talking to Geldron, but thanks for your rudeness
Sun Sep  8 12:54:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Geldron beeps? don't uyou have better things to do?
Sun Sep  8 16:44:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any idea what this means in C++:
Sun Sep  8 16:44:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:'new' not accessible because 'Thread' uses 'public' to inherit from 'CObject'
Sun Sep  8 16:44:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where I am compiling Driver which inherits Thread which inherits CObject
Sun Sep  8 16:59:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sun Sep  8 17:00:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what this message means
Sun Sep  8 17:01:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the code is:
Sun Sep  8 17:01:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ListenSocket *socket = new ListenSocket(telnet_port, PORT_TELNET);
Sun Sep  8 17:02:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am doing a new, and it is saying I cannot cause my inheritance is public
Sun Sep  8 17:03:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, I know what it is sorta.. :)
Sun Sep  8 17:04:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on all muds new is clone_object
Sun Sep  8 17:04:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with extra functionality related to classes
Sun Sep  8 17:05:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ListenSocket was private inheriting Thread... for some reason i thought I had checked that it was publically inheriting it
Sun Sep  8 17:09:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... lost the error message
Sun Sep  8 17:10:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:go to modems in your control panel
Sun Sep  8 17:13:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:righ
Sun Sep  8 17:22:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:given that I am doign this for windows, I could give a damn about portability
Sun Sep  8 17:22:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and C++ is not noticeably slower for things like muds
Sun Sep  8 17:24:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:C++ rocks C, but that is not hard
Sun Sep  8 17:24:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using C++ is perfectly portable if you do it with a minumum of common sense
Sun Sep  8 17:25:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not for the mud though
Sun Sep  8 17:25:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a mud is an ideal application for objectification
Sun Sep  8 21:25:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare
Sun Sep  8 21:25:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the best documented lib out there
Sun Sep  8 21:29:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably need to delete a single line from it
Sun Sep  8 21:29:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the bug tracking system is offline
Sun Sep  8 21:29:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the web one that is
Sun Sep  8 21:30:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the rwho command
Sun Sep  8 21:32:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know which line, read the code and figure it out, it should be simple
Sun Sep  8 23:39:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like what stuff?
Sun Sep  8 23:40:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, just do not change the server name or the mudlib name
Sun Sep  8 23:40:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just checking :)
Sun Sep  8 23:41:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's right
Sun Sep  8 23:42:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the license simply require you accept no money, never change the mudlib name, and retain all headers
Mon Sep  9 11:40:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people should not code on the mud
Mon Sep  9 11:40:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:code offline and ftp, use creremote, etc... type 'faq general' for more info
Mon Sep  9 11:41:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ed sucks
Mon Sep  9 11:42:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:vi sucks too
Mon Sep  9 11:42:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Mon Sep  9 11:42:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:show vi to any non-computer person
Mon Sep  9 11:42:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not suggesting emacs would be any better for a mud
Mon Sep  9 11:43:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people should use whatever editor they are familiar with
Mon Sep  9 11:44:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the magic of online?
Mon Sep  9 11:44:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creremote allows you to test your programs
Mon Sep  9 11:44:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes\
Mon Sep  9 11:45:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Sep  9 11:45:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in addition, with ange ftp or whetaver, you probably could be logged into the mud in one window and editing in another
Mon Sep  9 11:45:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no differernce
Mon Sep  9 11:45:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:issue the command
Mon Sep  9 11:46:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Leto, that is not online
Mon Sep  9 11:46:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:online is using the editor on the mud
Mon Sep  9 11:46:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creremote is a special client designed for editing
Mon Sep  9 11:47:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then why chose vi? why not let people use whatever editor they like?
Mon Sep  9 11:47:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, creremote and ange-ftp work just dandy
Mon Sep  9 11:48:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you do not give out XWindows
Mon Sep  9 11:48:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:faq general
Mon Sep  9 11:49:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops, faq lpmud
Mon Sep  9 11:52:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you care?
Mon Sep  9 11:52:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are like database keys, they don't matter
Mon Sep  9 11:52:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not for display
Mon Sep  9 11:53:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are the way they are, do with them what you will
Mon Sep  9 11:53:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:talk to the mud in charge of that channel
Mon Sep  9 11:55:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the main two channels are imud_code and imud_gossip
Mon Sep  9 11:56:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not have support for an imud_imud_code channel
Mon Sep  9 11:57:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I did not make up the channel names :)
Mon Sep  9 11:57:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just think they are unimportant
Mon Sep  9 11:58:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this mud does not support any channel called imud_imud_anything
Mon Sep  9 11:58:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:start an interfrog channel :)
Mon Sep  9 11:58:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kaolin, you are doing something on your end then :)
Mon Sep  9 12:04:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whoever is doing that crap from earth take it to imud_gossip please
Mon Sep  9 12:04:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Whizkid: ftp.imaginary.com
Mon Sep  9 12:48:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it tries to login whizkid yourpassword becauseit needs to login
Mon Sep  9 12:49:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:correct
Mon Sep  9 12:49:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why are you trying to seocnd guess what the protocol is doing?
Mon Sep  9 12:51:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you should not be telling it to login to the mud's telnet port
Mon Sep  9 12:52:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you login to the RCP port
Mon Sep  9 12:53:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know, try mudlist dreamer's hideaway
Mon Sep  9 12:53:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does say in the doc that that is normally your mud port - 10 I think
Mon Sep  9 12:58:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to create a remote object in your home directory, like it says in the document
Mon Sep  9 12:59:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the one with creremote
Mon Sep  9 13:00:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the mudlib release
Mon Sep  9 13:00:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there was one with the mudlib
Mon Sep  9 13:13:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is if you do not understand the concept of inheriting LIB_REMOTE in that file
Mon Sep  9 13:14:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create a file, and stick the line inherit LIB_REMOTE;
Mon Sep  9 13:14:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's all
Mon Sep  9 13:16:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not at the moment falchan
Mon Sep  9 13:16:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes dragon
Mon Sep  9 13:23:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hack the mud... not too hard with tmi
Mon Sep  9 14:56:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:win95 mudos+nightmare available at ftp.imaginary.com
Mon Sep  9 14:57:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is quite stable as the regular mudos setup
Mon Sep  9 14:58:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:plus it si a real windows 95 app
Mon Sep  9 14:58:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with install shield and a GUi front end
Mon Sep  9 14:58:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Ravnos, someone asked where it was, but thanks for the smartass comment anyway
Mon Sep  9 15:00:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it allows you to launch and configure the driver
Mon Sep  9 15:01:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I will add more stuff to it later
Mon Sep  9 15:01:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Mon Sep  9 15:01:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no config file, it uses the windows registry
Mon Sep  9 15:02:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ack?
Mon Sep  9 15:02:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it works fine
Mon Sep  9 15:03:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ob->eventDestruct()
Mon Sep  9 15:05:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot do ob = "ticket"
Mon Sep  9 15:05:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:"ticket" is a string
Mon Sep  9 15:05:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the win95 version is strictly 32 bit
Mon Sep  9 15:05:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means winnt or win95
Mon Sep  9 15:31:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make the subdires under /save/kills
Mon Sep  9 15:34:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you listen to what I said? or am I talking for the fun of it?
Mon Sep  9 15:36:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not bloody likely
Mon Sep  9 15:36:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said mkdir /saves/kills/<letter of the alphabet>
Mon Sep  9 15:37:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bingo
Mon Sep  9 15:38:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fix the problem
Mon Sep  9 15:38:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I said save the first time, and since there is a save directory, it would follow that the seond time was a typo
Mon Sep  9 15:39:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:furthermore, if you had looked at your error logs, you would have noticed an error in your error logs telling you what the bug was every time someone died
Mon Sep  9 15:43:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on all mudlibs it is the master object
Mon Sep  9 15:43:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not even tmi-2 right out allows peon access to the master object though
Mon Sep  9 15:45:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:read access does not allow you write access
Mon Sep  9 15:48:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably /log/httpd
Mon Sep  9 15:52:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fear Ravnos only being able to be happy by putting me down
Mon Sep  9 15:54:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sometimes I say funny things, sometimes I say serious things
Mon Sep  9 15:54:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:clearly Aristotle thought that was one of the funny things
Mon Sep  9 15:55:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:neither did I
Mon Sep  9 15:55:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your comment, however, was about *me* being referred to as too funny :)
Mon Sep  9 23:15:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just do not see what you get by the external stuff that is worth the risk I perceive
Mon Sep  9 23:15:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shit, I give my players external access
Mon Sep  9 23:22:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:arr = arr[0..elem-1] + arr[elem+1...];
Mon Sep  9 23:22:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err two . (elem+1..
Mon Sep  9 23:24:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:new_array = old_array[..elem_to_exclude-1] + old_array[elem_to_exclude+1..];
Mon Sep  9 23:25:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:replace_string() is a way to replace a substring in a string with another string
Mon Sep  9 23:26:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no it will not
Mon Sep  9 23:26:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the two are nothing alike :)
Mon Sep  9 23:27:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no problem Drew
Mon Sep  9 23:28:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is completely incorrect syntax, and does nothing like what you are saying it does
Mon Sep  9 23:28:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first: replace_string(array[4], "") generates an error
Mon Sep  9 23:29:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:second, what I think you are trying to say, is replace_string(array, aarry[4], "")
Mon Sep  9 23:29:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which would again be problematic since the func takes 3 strings
Mon Sep  9 23:30:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetWear() and SetWield()
Mon Sep  9 23:30:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eok, with array[4..4] you get something that replaces every occurrence of the substring array[4..4] woith nothing in a string
Mon Sep  9 23:31:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not exclude a single element of an array :)
Mon Sep  9 23:31:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and my point is not to humble you, but to make sure that Drew gets the right answer
Mon Sep  9 23:32:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and maybe even to help you so you can do it right when you encounter the problem in the future yourself
Mon Sep  9 23:33:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who won, GB or Phil?
Mon Sep  9 23:33:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool
Mon Sep  9 23:34:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fucked up is the Vikings on top of the NFC central with a perfect record
Mon Sep  9 23:35:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is definitely a gossip conversation :)... but, yes, they will definitely fall
Mon Sep  9 23:35:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the DWIKings suck
Mon Sep  9 23:38:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Packers won dork
Mon Sep  9 23:39:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not like you had me believing something important
Mon Sep  9 23:39:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't remember
Mon Sep  9 23:55:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why don't you give up your free time and write them
Mon Sep  9 23:57:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, referring to Gartha's comment :)
Mon Sep  9 23:57:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, sorry :(
Tue Sep 10 00:00:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my fault
Tue Sep 10 00:01:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some people expect that :)
Tue Sep 10 00:03:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:num + ""
Tue Sep 10 00:04:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cardinal()
Tue Sep 10 00:06:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:goddamn pagan shit
Tue Sep 10 00:09:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno
Tue Sep 10 00:09:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am trying to check
Tue Sep 10 00:15:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but using gethostbyaddr() even is cool since only the address server thread would be calling it
Tue Sep 10 00:18:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have dabbled a bit
Tue Sep 10 00:19:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I can't say, have not done enough... most of my MT coding has been in Java
Tue Sep 10 00:21:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Tue Sep 10 00:24:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does g++ have any class lib with it?>
Tue Sep 10 00:24:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what would I man to get info on libg++?
Tue Sep 10 00:26:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no thanks, it is not worth it :)
Tue Sep 10 00:28:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:perhaps eventually I could port the windows version to g++\
Tue Sep 10 00:29:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos
Tue Sep 10 00:30:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have been doing it in C++
Tue Sep 10 00:30:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so now I have a C++ driver that works for windows only
Tue Sep 10 01:10:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sweettarts
Tue Sep 10 01:11:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have heard people talk about those
Tue Sep 10 15:43:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:help files will nto work
Tue Sep 10 15:43:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean your kill command does not work?
Tue Sep 10 15:43:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no kill command with the NM lib]
Tue Sep 10 15:52:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for those with mudos nightmare for windows 32
Tue Sep 10 15:52:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mkdir /cmds/common and /secure/cmds/common and update /verbs/common/help.c and all will be fine
Tue Sep 10 16:01:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there running the win32 version of mudos?
Tue Sep 10 16:02:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how is it working for you?
Tue Sep 10 16:02:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean are there any problems that make it inferior to running it on UNIX?
Tue Sep 10 16:03:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would not be a win32 problem
Tue Sep 10 16:03:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what happens when you ry/
Tue Sep 10 16:04:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kalypso, for NM
Tue Sep 10 16:04:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try
Tue Sep 10 16:05:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LorKainn what happens when you try to wear it?
Tue Sep 10 16:05:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope, runnin on solaris
Tue Sep 10 16:07:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I need the full error message, but I need to run now... email it to be
Tue Sep 10 16:07:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kalypso then find someone who has the time to help you with ftpd
Tue Sep 10 16:08:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am publically on record as not helping people with that problem... too time consuming
Tue Sep 10 16:08:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what line
Tue Sep 10 16:08:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what filee
Tue Sep 10 16:09:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Tue Sep 10 16:09:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the ftpd is not part of the mudlib
Tue Sep 10 16:09:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is extra stuff I provide for your benefit
Tue Sep 10 16:10:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am not obligated to help you
Tue Sep 10 16:10:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:the error stated a line and a file number... what was the line and file number
Tue Sep 10 16:10:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I own the copyright on the lib whether I help you or not
Tue Sep 10 16:11:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and quite honestly you are being a prick by expecting me to bend over backwards to help you
Tue Sep 10 16:11:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially since it is an unrelated prodocut I have publically stated I DO NOT SUPPORT
Tue Sep 10 16:12:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LorKainn... that is not a bug
Tue Sep 10 16:12:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only players can wear armour :)
Tue Sep 10 16:12:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are a creator, and thus have no limbs
Tue Sep 10 20:53:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it doe snot matter at all
Tue Sep 10 20:54:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:type read
Tue Sep 10 21:21:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is old filtering code
Tue Sep 10 21:22:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those message classes are no longer used
Tue Sep 10 21:22:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you would recode interface.c so it would work like you wanted
Tue Sep 10 21:23:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IE is not what I call a noisy mud
Tue Sep 10 22:13:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they still have those?
Tue Sep 10 22:33:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:quake.imaginary.com for some quake
Tue Sep 10 23:19:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is there a light problem?
Tue Sep 10 23:19:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the problem?
Tue Sep 10 23:20:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it works fine on NM
Tue Sep 10 23:21:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I do not think everythign I write rocks
Tue Sep 10 23:21:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am able to tell the difference between thigns done wrong and things done right whether r not I am the author
Tue Sep 10 23:21:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, they work fine on NM
Tue Sep 10 23:22:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the light and match in what directory?>
Tue Sep 10 23:22:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the ones with NM IVr2.5 update fine
Tue Sep 10 23:23:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you did not do a fresh NM IVr2.5 install
Tue Sep 10 23:23:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you prbably have the match and torch code form the old lib
Tue Sep 10 23:23:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does not have an examples dir
Tue Sep 10 23:24:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where is this examples dir?
Tue Sep 10 23:24:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/domains/Ylsrim/etc/match.c and /domains/Ylsrim/etc/torch.c load fine
Tue Sep 10 23:25:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no "examples" dirs... Ylsrim is the example
Tue Sep 10 23:26:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what SMC 8416 is
Wed Sep 11 00:57:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud is the biggest mistake in mud history
Wed Sep 11 00:58:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one has opened a decent mud since its creation
Wed Sep 11 00:58:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:twits open up muds just to cause trouble on here
Wed Sep 11 00:59:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has led to too many mud admins and too few cres
Wed Sep 11 01:00:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Wed Sep 11 01:00:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not to the degree
Wed Sep 11 01:01:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many muds on I3 right now have more than 10 players on at this moment?
Wed Sep 11 01:02:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 11 01:02:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's my point
Wed Sep 11 01:02:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can count everyone
Wed Sep 11 01:03:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intercre is useful for learning code
Wed Sep 11 01:03:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but really, what percentage of I3 traffic is code related?
Wed Sep 11 01:04:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Valentino, ostensibly people code games for people to play them
Wed Sep 11 01:05:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fear every dork starting a mud
Wed Sep 11 01:05:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if everyone runs a mud, there is no one to play
Wed Sep 11 01:06:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dissatisfied coders?
Wed Sep 11 01:07:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Hern, they think they could do better
Wed Sep 11 01:07:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone thinks he can do better
Wed Sep 11 01:08:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so they and their friends start a mud, realize how much work it is, yap on intermud, lose their site, and accomplish nothing
Wed Sep 11 01:08:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Hern... admins being pricks is a relatively small problem
Wed Sep 11 01:09:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any mud which gets to have a decent following and is actually open must be doing something right
Wed Sep 11 01:09:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah... stands to reason since 99% of the muds do not get that far
Wed Sep 11 01:10:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you are free to disagree, but my opinion stems from 5 years of admin experience on different muds
Wed Sep 11 01:12:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if admins are complete jerks, their mud will never get far enough to have a player base
Wed Sep 11 01:13:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is just too damn hard to get a mud open for bonified jerks to succeed
Wed Sep 11 01:13:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Archon is not what I call a success
Wed Sep 11 01:14:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IdeaExchange is not a game
Wed Sep 11 01:15:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know a lot of successful ones
Wed Sep 11 01:15:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they generally have more than 6 people on at a time though
Wed Sep 11 01:17:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not a real mud then :)
Wed Sep 11 01:17:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are a lot of NM syphon muds
Wed Sep 11 01:18:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are down now :)
Wed Sep 11 01:20:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sure it had nothing to do with the fact that you are a complete twit
Wed Sep 11 01:21:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:skylight, I think you miss the point
Wed Sep 11 01:21:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if someone bans you, and you login and they do not know it, they still win
Wed Sep 11 01:21:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because, see, clearly you are not doing the things they banned you for
Wed Sep 11 11:23:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would you inherit body and item?
Wed Sep 11 11:36:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eval return here->GetShort()
Wed Sep 11 11:37:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier is right
Wed Sep 11 11:37:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call is quicker, but less powerful
Wed Sep 11 11:41:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eval return environment(find_player("whoever"))->GetShort()
Wed Sep 11 11:45:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:type ls
Wed Sep 11 11:45:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 11 12:05:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier, wanna unblock tells?
Wed Sep 11 12:40:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people who use your code without permission
Wed Sep 11 12:41:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:CoreDump is insisting they can change their mudlib name
Wed Sep 11 12:41:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is a violation of the NM licensing agreement
Wed Sep 11 12:42:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, no, they cannot
Wed Sep 11 12:42:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and they have  not 100% rewritten it anyways
Wed Sep 11 12:42:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sorta depends how they rewrote the code
Wed Sep 11 12:43:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no matter how much you rewrite of a system, if you are usingit as your base, it is considered a derivative work under copyright laws
Wed Sep 11 12:43:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because your system would not exist without the base system
Wed Sep 11 12:44:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not vague :L)
Wed Sep 11 12:45:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am not claiming authorship of that code
Wed Sep 11 12:45:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am requesting that you honour the licensing agreement under which you developed that other code
Wed Sep 11 12:45:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/lib/Nightmare/Agreement for the NM license agreement
Wed Sep 11 12:46:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first off, I do not want to get into the guessing game of how much person X has modified my code
Wed Sep 11 12:46:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I have a rather strict license
Wed Sep 11 12:47:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the license states:
Wed Sep 11 12:47:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:4) All works based on this library are considered DERIVATIVE WORKS and
Wed Sep 11 12:47:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange: All works based on this library are considered DERIVATIVE WORKS and
Wed Sep 11 12:47:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the license is on the code you used asshole
Wed Sep 11 12:47:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you used my code to develop that code
Wed Sep 11 12:48:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you did not want to abide by my license agreement, you should not have used my mudlib
Wed Sep 11 12:48:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:me? no I would not
Wed Sep 11 12:49:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have structured NM so I can prove this shit :)
Wed Sep 11 12:50:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:plus, besides that, it is proveable without such trickery
Wed Sep 11 12:50:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Panther: I go after every one I see
Wed Sep 11 12:51:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Rot: I would have plenty of ability to sue... the law is behind me, and I have money
Wed Sep 11 12:51:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Pickett
Wed Sep 11 12:51:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM looks nothing like TMI
Wed Sep 11 12:51:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I specifically wrote NM from scratch to avoid these issues
Wed Sep 11 12:51:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the original NM was written with TMI as a base
Wed Sep 11 12:52:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do write software for a living
Wed Sep 11 12:52:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I also do it for free to help people build muds
Wed Sep 11 12:52:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not expect money from those people, but I do expect them to abide by the agreement under which they use my stuff
Wed Sep 11 12:53:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rot: you need to spend more time with NM... it has nothing in common with TMI exdept it uses the LPC language
Wed Sep 11 12:54:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/lib/Nightmare
Wed Sep 11 12:56:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the windows version of NM is really easy :)
Wed Sep 11 12:56:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it uses installshield
Wed Sep 11 12:56:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the UNIX version is also easy, but you could run into some perl snags
Wed Sep 11 12:56:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but any common problems are answered on the web page
Wed Sep 11 12:56:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: yes, I borrowed a couple of simul efuns... those are consistent with the TMI-2 license
Wed Sep 11 12:56:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea Chiapet
Wed Sep 11 12:56:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and TMI-2 has some of my code
Wed Sep 11 12:57:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is not stolen because I am not on violation of the tmi-2 license agreement
Wed Sep 11 12:57:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rot: why should I get into a guessing game about code percentages?
Wed Sep 11 12:58:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Nightmare version is native win32 code
Wed Sep 11 12:58:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would run faster than the tmi-2 one
Wed Sep 11 12:58:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier I can stick code into the mudlibas long as it does not violate their license
Wed Sep 11 12:58:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rot: that does not work
Wed Sep 11 12:59:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rot: I specified up front a license agreement
Wed Sep 11 12:59:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:CoreDump did not have to use my code, they did
Wed Sep 11 13:00:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a derivative work
Wed Sep 11 13:00:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I doubt you could get it to 0% my code
Wed Sep 11 13:00:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in a reasonable time frame
Wed Sep 11 13:00:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it can
Wed Sep 11 13:00:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are talking about a license agreement under which he used Nightmare
Wed Sep 11 13:01:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, yes, the y have both
Wed Sep 11 13:01:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everything is copyrighted
Wed Sep 11 13:01:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is just that melville has no license
Wed Sep 11 13:03:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never said the derivitive code was mine... it is yours and copyright to yoyu
Wed Sep 11 13:03:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but as a derivative work, that work must still abide by the original license
Wed Sep 11 13:03:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I suggest you read up on the concept of a derivative work
Wed Sep 11 13:03:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is why MudOS cannot be commercially license
Wed Sep 11 13:04:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:almost all of the code has been rewritten, but it is derivative
Wed Sep 11 13:04:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: you used Nightmare under a specific license
Wed Sep 11 13:04:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they can accept donations panther
Wed Sep 11 13:05:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: you have to live with that license
Wed Sep 11 13:05:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:You can accept donations so long as they go to the machien and such
Wed Sep 11 13:06:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier, that is not the same thing
Wed Sep 11 13:06:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the editor is not a code base for your work
Wed Sep 11 13:07:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't get it do you...
Wed Sep 11 13:07:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you are did you not use Nightmare as a base?
Wed Sep 11 13:07:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my code is a base, I coudl see that by logging in for a few seconds
Wed Sep 11 13:08:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: you have to abide by the licensing agreement for the use of NM
Wed Sep 11 13:08:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and this is exactly why I do not want to get into % games
Wed Sep 11 13:08:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not need to get through it
Wed Sep 11 13:09:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:CountZero: the requirements vary based on the license in question
Wed Sep 11 13:09:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the nightmare license explicitly states you cannot change the mudlib name
Wed Sep 11 13:10:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the lima license states that if you change the mudlib name, you have to pay a $5000 yearly license
Wed Sep 11 13:10:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you root Xavier?
Wed Sep 11 13:11:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nonsense Cratylus
Wed Sep 11 13:12:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the difference is that CoreDump and other mdus start with Nightmare, make changes, and eventually get to X% changed
Wed Sep 11 13:12:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what a derivative work is
Wed Sep 11 13:13:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Panther if you wrote the entire thing without using NM at all, it is not derivative
Wed Sep 11 13:14:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know Diku muds have to display the original author names no matter how many changes people make
Wed Sep 11 13:14:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Chiapet
Wed Sep 11 13:15:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what are you talking about Xavier?
Wed Sep 11 13:16:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is *my code*... I do havig why should I let you use my stuff?
Wed Sep 11 13:17:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you make it sound as if it is your god given right to use mny code
Wed Sep 11 13:18:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is not a collective code
Wed Sep 11 13:18:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is a package under a very specific license
Wed Sep 11 13:19:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am concerned about the mudlib name... I have no problem with any other claims he makes
Wed Sep 11 13:19:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, NM is not GNU
Wed Sep 11 13:20:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/lib/Nightmare/Agreement
Wed Sep 11 13:21:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the package... and yes, it does include those efuns
Wed Sep 11 13:22:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Bob's MUD says that it is their mud... the mudlib name is what I require in the license
Wed Sep 11 13:22:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the license, the copyright refers the the packaging, which is a separate issue from individual files
Wed Sep 11 13:23:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the files, according to tmi-2 licensing restrictions, retain separate header and copyright info
Wed Sep 11 13:23:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, in a subsection of the International copyright laws
Wed Sep 11 13:24:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never told you what to name your mud
Wed Sep 11 13:25:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh :) no
Wed Sep 11 13:25:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:good point though
Wed Sep 11 13:25:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because that is a violation of the license
Wed Sep 11 13:25:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right Chiapet
Wed Sep 11 13:26:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes,m Panther, that is why I am so active in defenjding this
Wed Sep 11 13:27:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I do not defend my license, it loses its punch]
Wed Sep 11 13:27:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ownership of individual code is noted in the header files
Wed Sep 11 13:28:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would you see this letter?
Wed Sep 11 13:29:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 I would not believe it that easy to remove stuff that is mine in a day
Wed Sep 11 13:29:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 assuming it were, you still miss the point
Wed Sep 11 13:29:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:CoreDump is a derivative
Wed Sep 11 13:30:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would you see mail for root@kungce?
Wed Sep 11 13:30:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not my standing the mud community that is even relevant here
Wed Sep 11 13:30:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I were someone and CoreDump was the only mud  isng my lib, it is still just as bad
Wed Sep 11 13:31:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier, are you root?
Wed Sep 11 13:32:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:save me time, if you are root, I will just get in touch with your ISP
Wed Sep 11 13:32:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:license violation is just as bad
Wed Sep 11 13:34:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which ignores the fact you have used the mudlib for a while to get the mud where it is
Wed Sep 11 13:35:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is rather big :)
Wed Sep 11 13:36:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would expect it to take you at least a yera to develop that lib
Wed Sep 11 13:37:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:2 1/2 years nightmare based
Wed Sep 11 13:37:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you would have to start over again to avoid being NM derived
Wed Sep 11 13:38:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the original NM was TMI-based, and I wanted to change that, so I had to start from scratch and rewrite everything in order to legitimately claim original authorship
Wed Sep 11 13:38:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would expect you to have to do the same
Wed Sep 11 13:39:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you would not be able to use the code you wrote, sicne it is derived from my code
Wed Sep 11 13:39:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just like I could not use the code I wrote based on tmi-1
Wed Sep 11 13:40:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has taken me a long time... I am still trying to get NM to the stability level I had before I started nearly 4 years ago
Wed Sep 11 13:40:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: do you understand the concept of derivative work?>
Wed Sep 11 13:41:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Blue: yes... I think in the library of congress site
Wed Sep 11 13:42:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:www.loc.gov
Wed Sep 11 13:42:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I borrowed code from another lib... there is a difference there
Wed Sep 11 13:43:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my code based existed first, and then I pulled in boring stuff from tmi
Wed Sep 11 13:43:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: your derivative code is subject to my license
Wed Sep 11 13:43:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just like that tmi code is subject to tmi license
Wed Sep 11 13:44:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I cannot borrow it and free it from its license
Wed Sep 11 13:45:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, if I ever sell NM, I have to remove that code
Wed Sep 11 13:45:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, that parrticular code is gone from NM now, since NM uses the new ed
Wed Sep 11 13:46:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah Saint, let everyone steal everyone else's code
Wed Sep 11 13:46:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Xavier, you still do not understand :)
Wed Sep 11 13:46:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who cares what I am programming for Saint?
Wed Sep 11 13:47:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are talking about the code base you used to develop your entire existing lib
Wed Sep 11 13:49:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you never inherited code I wrote?
Wed Sep 11 13:49:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:used pieces of NM code in your objects?
Wed Sep 11 13:49:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:built around the existing rooms while you built monster obejcts to go in them?
Wed Sep 11 13:50:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would I rewrite update?
Wed Sep 11 13:50:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Prometheus: the cost of a NM license is adherence to the copyright
Wed Sep 11 13:50:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err license
Wed Sep 11 13:51:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Prometheus: you don't have 5 years invested in a muydlib being used by hundreds of people, now, do you?
Wed Sep 11 13:52:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right Saint:  it is not like I am writing a book on Java, written magazine articles, chapters for other books, make a lot of money programming, etc
Wed Sep 11 13:53:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I protect my property rights, I am not well-adjusted?
Wed Sep 11 13:53:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: that does not cut it
Wed Sep 11 13:53:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Prometheus and I might criticize yourt television habits
Wed Sep 11 13:54:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, if I were to use Lima as an example, he would have to send me $5000 yearly
Wed Sep 11 13:54:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the cost of the license is display of the mudlib name as stated in the license
Wed Sep 11 13:55:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have already used NM to get where you are
Wed Sep 11 13:55:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot suddenly disavow that use
Wed Sep 11 13:56:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier... your weak attempts to assure yourself you have a leg to stand on are getting old
Wed Sep 11 13:56:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you more than simply used ed to edit your code and update to see if it loaded
Wed Sep 11 13:57:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, that does not change the fact that *your* code is derivative code
Wed Sep 11 13:57:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it did, Beek would be selling mudos right now
Wed Sep 11 13:58:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it did, I would not have spent all of this time rewriting NM to get away from its original tmi-1 base
Wed Sep 11 13:58:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you used my code
Wed Sep 11 13:58:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you used the Nightmare mudlib
Wed Sep 11 13:59:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your new objects certainly had a base in existing objects, and were tested using existing objects
Wed Sep 11 14:00:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 11 14:00:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are two issues here:
Wed Sep 11 14:00:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 CoreDump used NM in developing their current system... that means they were subvject to NM licensing
Wed Sep 11 14:01:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 CoreDump used NM code to develop their current system, that also makes them subvject to NM licensing
Wed Sep 11 14:02:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means you cannot suddenly disavow that usage today because it is inconvenient
Wed Sep 11 14:02:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Pickett, do you have a fucking clue about copyright and licensing issues?
Wed Sep 11 14:02:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no wonder sumu comes down on that side.. they renamed their tmi-2 lib
Wed Sep 11 14:02:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not that bad Duuktsaryth :)
Wed Sep 11 14:03:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is you used the NM mudlib given the license
Wed Sep 11 14:03:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are required to abide by that license or not use it
Wed Sep 11 14:04:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Pickett: I can tell from here it is tmi-2
Wed Sep 11 14:04:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are being disingenuous... it is just tmi-2 has no sucj restrictions
Wed Sep 11 14:05:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Xavier: it is too late to say "wow, I am not using the lib"
Wed Sep 11 14:05:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because the code you have would not exist if it were not for your use of the lib
Wed Sep 11 14:06:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have had this conversation with several muds, and never have they refused to comply like this
Wed Sep 11 14:07:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what you are talking about Xavier... serious about what?
Wed Sep 11 14:08:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am dead serious
Wed Sep 11 14:08:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, one time, one mud refused... it is no longer up
Wed Sep 11 14:08:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no myth
Wed Sep 11 14:08:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops, no myth
Wed Sep 11 14:08:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:put his mudlib name back to Nightmare
Wed Sep 11 14:09:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Prometheus, I can make cash with it
Wed Sep 11 14:10:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depends on your license Prometheus
Wed Sep 11 14:11:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not boether me, however, that you do not value the time I have put into NM, Prometheus
Wed Sep 11 14:11:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe if you had put that sort of time into a mudlib, you might care differently
Wed Sep 11 14:12:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:control freak == someone who protects his property rights
Wed Sep 11 14:12:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok
Wed Sep 11 14:12:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mind if I come in and take your computer?
Wed Sep 11 14:13:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is someone else using your code?
Wed Sep 11 14:13:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too late Xavier, it is already an integral base of everythign you have done
Wed Sep 11 14:13:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not have to be Myth :)
Wed Sep 11 14:14:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really myth
Wed Sep 11 14:14:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just have to prove that you wrote it
Wed Sep 11 14:15:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have never seen that
Wed Sep 11 14:15:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you may be confusing against a defense of did not know
Wed Sep 11 14:16:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if a person can legitimately claim they did not know about the copyright, then there is a limit
Wed Sep 11 14:16:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot claim with NM ou did not know however, since copyrights are displayed everywhere
Wed Sep 11 14:17:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the registry exists as undeniable proof you wrote what you claimed to have written when you did it
Wed Sep 11 14:17:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you have it on disk, mailing yourself a copy works just as wekk :)
Wed Sep 11 14:18:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because US postal service cancel stamps are admissible in court
Wed Sep 11 14:19:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or anyone else
Wed Sep 11 14:19:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I happen to think code thievery is serious
Wed Sep 11 14:20:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sure common thieves also thing shoplifting is fun
Wed Sep 11 14:20:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does not mean they are anythng more than common thieves
Wed Sep 11 14:21:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that is what you are when you violate a license
Wed Sep 11 14:21:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try to sue... you are in violation of my license, and thus a thief
Wed Sep 11 14:22:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a hardass is someone who screams thief when a person is trying to steal something?
Wed Sep 11 14:23:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:circular argument
Wed Sep 11 14:23:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Timewalker
Wed Sep 11 14:23:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you can Broken
Wed Sep 11 14:24:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I expect recognition for what I have done
Wed Sep 11 14:24:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a copyright Broken
Wed Sep 11 14:24:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can make money off of it
Wed Sep 11 14:24:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:second, you do not need to be making money in order to sue
Wed Sep 11 14:25:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Saint: I appreciate you dictating to me what should be my reasons for coding
Wed Sep 11 14:25:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:violation of property rights is a tort, and there are precendents
Wed Sep 11 14:26:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 I am not suing at this time
Wed Sep 11 14:26:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am arguing the fact that Xavier is a thief
Wed Sep 11 14:27:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however, I would not be afraid to sue to protect my rights
Wed Sep 11 14:27:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the other option is to remove NM from the Internet
Wed Sep 11 14:27:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Thief is exactly the right word
Wed Sep 11 14:28:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I cannot protect the code I write, i will not allow others to useit
Wed Sep 11 14:28:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can sue over property
Wed Sep 11 14:28:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does have a monetary value that I can prove
Wed Sep 11 14:29:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I cannot prevent them from using, I can prevent them from allowingothers to use it
Wed Sep 11 14:29:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would not sue for money... I would sue to get him to comply with the licene
Wed Sep 11 14:30:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: you are violating my license
Wed Sep 11 14:30:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Timewalker: his code is derivative code
Wed Sep 11 14:31:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/lib/Nightmare/Agreement
Wed Sep 11 14:31:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is still using my code in violation of my agreement
Wed Sep 11 14:32:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Broken: you do not understand what is in NM or what a copyright is
Wed Sep 11 14:32:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and this is also a question of license violation, not copyright infringement
Wed Sep 11 14:33:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wrote most of the files in the mudlib, the set is packaged under a license
Wed Sep 11 14:33:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don;t care Xavier, that is not what the license says
Wed Sep 11 14:33:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a work is copyrighted the minute it is written Broken
Wed Sep 11 14:33:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are writing a book, you should know that
Wed Sep 11 14:34:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my license is reasonable, and not unusual
Wed Sep 11 14:34:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Broken... we are not talking about one room, we are talking about a software product
Wed Sep 11 14:34:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are also talking about one that is not a hodge podge of creator code, it is written almost entireely by me
Wed Sep 11 14:35:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the work that is not mine is written under an agreement stated I can copyright the work
Wed Sep 11 14:35:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have covered nmyass Broken
Wed Sep 11 14:36:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are the one who does not know what he is talking about
Wed Sep 11 14:36:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is my work, and my license for my package
Wed Sep 11 14:36:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oddly enougj, i used to work for judge wapner
Wed Sep 11 14:37:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:broken: I have been dealing with copyrights for 8 years
Wed Sep 11 14:37:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my background is no computers bozo
Wed Sep 11 14:37:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is television
Wed Sep 11 14:37:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am a published author as well
Wed Sep 11 14:38:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in computers, telelvision, and publishing, you should know somethign about copyrights
Wed Sep 11 14:38:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at this time, we are not talking about suing
Wed Sep 11 14:38:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are talking about mu rights
Wed Sep 11 14:39:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not true Timewalker
Wed Sep 11 14:39:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I hope no NM muds are compatible
Wed Sep 11 14:39:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what should fit me?
Wed Sep 11 14:40:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is a codebase...  it provides a clear notification of the fact that thigns you develop with it are derivative as provided in the international copyright laws
Wed Sep 11 14:40:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try it
Wed Sep 11 14:41:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not permission
Wed Sep 11 14:41:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are more ways to protect your rights than suing in court
Wed Sep 11 14:42:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the only person to date who has refused no longer has mud and no longer has internet access
Wed Sep 11 14:43:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me ask you twerps this... Broken and Saint... if you spent 5 years on something, would you not want credit for it?
Wed Sep 11 14:43:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wouldn't you be pissed if those people snubbed their noses at you?
Wed Sep 11 14:44:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one ever does
Wed Sep 11 14:44:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:skill level and a number 1-5
Wed Sep 11 14:45:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's a lugh
Wed Sep 11 14:45:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you know what I get from people? endless gried
Wed Sep 11 14:45:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why does this not work, this sucks, i could do this better... blah blah blah
Wed Sep 11 14:45:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:1 is primary, 5 is pentinary
Wed Sep 11 14:46:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me emphasize too... I could have structured deals to charge for this stuff
Wed Sep 11 14:46:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would have required me writing a server from scratch or converting to DGD
Wed Sep 11 14:47:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I chose not to do it because I value giving it for free more
Wed Sep 11 14:47:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so those of you suggesting that what I am doing is somehow worth less cause I don't charge should go fuck yourselves
Wed Sep 11 14:48:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what I charge is your adherence to my license
Wed Sep 11 14:48:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you can't pay, don;t use the liv
Wed Sep 11 14:49:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you know, I might enjoy that Saint...
Wed Sep 11 14:49:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I did not simply get loads of endless crapo from them
Wed Sep 11 14:49:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just get people bitching and moaning
Wed Sep 11 14:49:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the other day, kriton I think was actually complaining because I did not have time to help him
Wed Sep 11 14:50:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I am feaking obligated to help whomever
Wed Sep 11 14:50:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sorry i don't meet your requirements for canonization Saint
Wed Sep 11 14:50:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but until you have done what I have done, I suggest you not throw stones
Wed Sep 11 14:51:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so what?
Wed Sep 11 14:51:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then, Timewalker, why does CoreDump not abide by my license?
Wed Sep 11 14:52:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Saint... this is the real world, I tried it that way once before, it does not work
Wed Sep 11 14:52:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at all the tmi-2 muds which have been renamed
Wed Sep 11 14:53:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not suggesting you change ownership of the code you wrote... nor can I
Wed Sep 11 14:53:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudlib name is not a sign of code ownership, that is what header files are for
Wed Sep 11 14:53:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudlib name is a condition expressedin a license to recognize the base of the work in quyestion
Wed Sep 11 14:54:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to write your own lib and determine how that workds for it
Wed Sep 11 14:54:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the fact still remains that you are using NM and subject to the NM liucense
Wed Sep 11 14:55:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Wed Sep 11 14:57:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier's work is credited in the header files
Wed Sep 11 14:57:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib name is not credit for X amount of files codeed
Wed Sep 11 14:58:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib name states what you used to derive your mud from
Wed Sep 11 14:58:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, then you need to think of a different way to show that then
Wed Sep 11 14:58:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib name is mine, accoridng to the license
Wed Sep 11 14:59:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no problem with that Timewalker... do that however...
Wed Sep 11 14:59:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib name though is mine
Wed Sep 11 15:00:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is much better stated than I have been putting it
Wed Sep 11 15:01:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are nte required to think it fair
Wed Sep 11 15:02:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is soemthing that should have been considered back when NM was first chosen
Wed Sep 11 15:02:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some people do not think it fair that you have to pay for software
Wed Sep 11 15:04:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Leto, but they are saying they have rewritten X% of it
Wed Sep 11 15:04:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but the NM license states that I do not are how much you have rewritten (specifically to avoid getting into how much is enough)
Wed Sep 11 15:04:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is based on the derivative works clause of the international copyright laws
Wed Sep 11 15:05:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is Broken and Saint who are being twerps at the moment
Wed Sep 11 15:06:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are wrong, Broken, to think i would do nothing abotu it
Wed Sep 11 15:06:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically, I suppose Cratylus :)
Wed Sep 11 15:07:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though I did ask in private first and was basically told to fuck off
Wed Sep 11 15:08:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Timewalker: the work is in the very least derived from my work
Wed Sep 11 15:10:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is comforting
Wed Sep 11 15:10:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have no idea what I take seriously
Wed Sep 11 15:11:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:judging what I deem important from this conversation would be a serious mistake
Wed Sep 11 15:11:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Saint did a funny
Wed Sep 11 15:12:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how old are you? you pick up girls in malls?
Wed Sep 11 15:13:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just don;t know where the parties are then
Wed Sep 11 15:14:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where I went to school, only tue had no parties
Wed Sep 11 15:15:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh brother.. you really don't want to get into a contest with me on this... especially if you pick up "girls" in malls
Wed Sep 11 15:16:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you make some bizarre assumption that I do not have a girlfriend
Wed Sep 11 15:16:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is bad to assume
Wed Sep 11 15:16:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have not been single in 8 years
Wed Sep 11 15:17:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Leto has spoken to my girlfriend
Wed Sep 11 15:18:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't care if you believe it or not :)
Wed Sep 11 15:18:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just fiind your belief that my life centers around the mudlib laughable.
Wed Sep 11 15:18:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and then you compound it with other assumptions equally laughable
Wed Sep 11 15:19:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you must have a fulfilling life if that is how you get your jollies
Wed Sep 11 15:20:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that and picking up girls in malls
Wed Sep 11 15:20:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Timewalker, assuming you are 100% correct, it does not matter
Wed Sep 11 15:20:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that does not change the license
Wed Sep 11 15:21:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one has argued against that
Wed Sep 11 15:21:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said that the mudlib name is not where he gets his credit
Wed Sep 11 15:22:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sure, but not in the mudlib name
Wed Sep 11 15:25:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I need to go... I ask you to please change the mudlib name back to Nightmare
Wed Sep 11 15:36:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetAttack((: func :))
Wed Sep 11 15:37:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does minimal distinction between players and NPC's
Wed Sep 11 15:37:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on pur[pose
Wed Sep 11 17:21:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it looks like we are sending in F117 bombers
Wed Sep 11 17:21:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the coallition Bush put together is perhaps the most impressive foreign policy accomplishment in american history
Wed Sep 11 17:21:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Clinton is pissing that away
Wed Sep 11 17:29:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Iran is not pleased
Wed Sep 11 17:29:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Iran may hate Iraq, but they are not stupid enough to think american bombs flyign around them is a good thing
Wed Sep 11 17:33:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Clinton really sucks at foreign policy
Wed Sep 11 19:25:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos matrices might be best
Wed Sep 11 19:25:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I know jack shit about them
Wed Sep 11 19:25:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok :)
Wed Sep 11 19:26:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, a mapping then
Wed Sep 11 19:26:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define what you mean y search?
Wed Sep 11 19:26:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by
Wed Sep 11 19:27:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:find x for given y and vice versa?
Wed Sep 11 19:27:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is too much match shit for me to understand :)
Wed Sep 11 19:27:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err math
Wed Sep 11 19:28:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the real Descartes is one of the founders of modern geometry
Wed Sep 11 19:28:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course, I am not the real Descartes :)
Wed Sep 11 19:29:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know philosophy, but I am a poor mathematician
Wed Sep 11 21:45:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no way to change the prompt currently
Wed Sep 11 21:45:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos does support that, but it is not currently codedfully into NM
Wed Sep 11 21:46:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Thu Sep 12 01:04:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in /verbs, yes
Thu Sep 12 01:04:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you write it once, why should someone else not be able to use it?
Thu Sep 12 01:04:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rare or not?
Thu Sep 12 01:05:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using the parser? or just plain vanilla verbs?
Thu Sep 12 01:06:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the vanilla stuff does not get you much
Thu Sep 12 01:06:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it beats add_action(), but it cannot do complex parsing
Thu Sep 12 01:07:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:situation here:
Thu Sep 12 01:07:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:aliens coming at the earth...
Thu Sep 12 01:07:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you get a message from them, but you cannot understand it... what do you do?
Thu Sep 12 01:07:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:assuming you are the pres of the US
Thu Sep 12 01:09:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe it is time to stop doing things for free for you all and write games for money
Thu Sep 12 01:10:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Gandhi: you don't get my point
Thu Sep 12 01:10:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am suggesting that you people are not worth the free stuff
Thu Sep 12 01:11:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and people could not use the free stuff since I would rescind their ability to use it
Thu Sep 12 01:11:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:plus anything I would charge money for would be in a different league
Thu Sep 12 01:11:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:simple... I would remove it from all ftp sites
Thu Sep 12 01:12:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't have the right to give copies away
Thu Sep 12 01:12:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can stop people from distributing copies they have
Thu Sep 12 01:12:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I cannot rescind licenses being used in good faith
Thu Sep 12 01:12:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is my code, you license it from me
Thu Sep 12 01:12:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, they do have the legal right to give it away
Thu Sep 12 01:13:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Id allows them to do it
Thu Sep 12 01:13:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are talking about registered copies, a mud is not like doom
Thu Sep 12 01:14:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I could prevent them from using it
Thu Sep 12 01:14:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you see, in order to use it, thyey have to make it publically accessible
Thu Sep 12 01:14:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not like doom where you can use it in private
Thu Sep 12 01:15:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I agree woith Gandhi
Thu Sep 12 01:15:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no intention to go on such a witch hunt
Thu Sep 12 01:15:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:realistically, I could
Thu Sep 12 01:15:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, most ISP's will not stand for software pirates making use of their services
Thu Sep 12 01:16:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yo: brainiac: I am not talkiing about lawsuits
Thu Sep 12 01:17:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle: maybe you should listen to what I am saying instead of making up things to argue abvout
Thu Sep 12 01:17:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I already stated them... you were making things up
Thu Sep 12 01:18:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said I would not have any intention of going on a witch hunt
Thu Sep 12 01:18:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and then i said furthermore, to do what I suggest i do not even have to take legal action since ISP's don't want pirated software on their systems
Thu Sep 12 01:18:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you continued harping on how much it would cost to take legal action anyways
Thu Sep 12 01:19:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am acting like I have been providing a service which I get nothing but grief from
Thu Sep 12 01:19:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am getting tired of the grief
Thu Sep 12 01:20:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now, I have CoreDump stealing my code and calling me a hardass cause I wish to protect my property rights
Thu Sep 12 01:21:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I was going to go on to say that the level of intelligence demonstrated among the mud community is extremely low
Thu Sep 12 01:21:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i.e. you people
Thu Sep 12 01:21:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and thus not worth the time
Thu Sep 12 01:22:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Aristotle is only using some of my code... he is using TM<I-2
Thu Sep 12 01:22:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really anything significant
Thu Sep 12 01:23:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:TMI-2 has my code in it Aristotle
Thu Sep 12 01:23:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you know?
Thu Sep 12 01:23:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you even know what I wrote for tmi-2?
Thu Sep 12 01:24:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not as simple as that, unfortunately
Thu Sep 12 01:25:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it just kinda made a point to me
Thu Sep 12 01:25:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I was hypothesizing I would not
Thu Sep 12 01:27:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me try to make my point in a less confrontational tone...
Thu Sep 12 01:28:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 I started writing the lib basically to see what could be done
Thu Sep 12 01:28:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at the time, there was nothing for MudOS (MudOS was the new kid on the block)
Thu Sep 12 01:28:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I figured that what my mud went through to get open sucked... at the time everyone was used to having 2.4.5 to start from...
Thu Sep 12 01:29:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I thought I would provide what I had done to people
Thu Sep 12 01:29:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I kept coding, because there was so much I wanted to do for the mud NM
Thu Sep 12 01:29:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I kept releasing stuff
Thu Sep 12 01:30:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is that every body thinks they can do it better
Thu Sep 12 01:30:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and they like to tell you how much you did sucks and how much better they can do it
Thu Sep 12 01:30:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:really
Thu Sep 12 01:31:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have never had a problem with Lima... anything they don't like about Nightmare, they either do better or at least try to do better
Thu Sep 12 01:31:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and they don't give me bullshit about it either
Thu Sep 12 01:32:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Lima and NM have never been at war... I have always seen us on the same team
Thu Sep 12 01:32:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the two muds together have helped get the parser debugged
Thu Sep 12 01:33:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle.. you may hear people complaining about the way i act, because I do tear into them
Thu Sep 12 01:33:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if people piss me off, I will return fire
Thu Sep 12 01:34:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you may not hear people attack my code, but they do...
Thu Sep 12 01:34:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I don't even mind it if they can point to something real... like how the NM bboards suck
Thu Sep 12 01:35:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is because I don't turn the other cheek
Thu Sep 12 01:35:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, if someone says NM sucks, I ask them to prove it
Thu Sep 12 01:35:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then people say i can't take criticism
Thu Sep 12 01:35:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle, nice theory, but like I said, everyone thinks they can do better... they see bugs in the mudlib and like to siezx eon them
Thu Sep 12 01:36:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example...
Thu Sep 12 01:36:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are a lot of people who say nice things about me
Thu Sep 12 01:36:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I would not call that 7 feet up my butthole
Thu Sep 12 01:36:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one of the reasons you do not hear it publically a lot is because some yahoo then accuses them of kissing my ass
Thu Sep 12 01:37:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every single time someone says anything like what Gandhi says, someone else says what you say Aristotle
Thu Sep 12 01:37:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is more prestigious to attack me than to say something nice about me
Thu Sep 12 01:38:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Gandhi was not saying anything I would call ass kissing...
Thu Sep 12 01:38:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe you should see the people that log in here and start bowing to me and ask "Are you THE descartes?"
Thu Sep 12 01:38:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:egomaniacal?
Thu Sep 12 01:38:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at yourself...
Thu Sep 12 01:39:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you attacked someone who said somethign nice about me
Thu Sep 12 01:39:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:clearly that demonstrates right here that someone gets a better public light by attacking me
Thu Sep 12 01:39:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think you are reading way too much into that
Thu Sep 12 01:40:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and like I said, that is what happens any time anyone says anything nice about me
Thu Sep 12 01:42:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Deathblade... the evil traitor
Thu Sep 12 01:42:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not that I rrally blame him
Thu Sep 12 01:43:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:stock options in MS are much more valuable than a one time money deal
Thu Sep 12 01:45:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nonsense... MS is valuable bakrupt
Thu Sep 12 01:46:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, but certain stock is damn near guaranteed
Thu Sep 12 01:47:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a MS break up would make stock holders rich
Thu Sep 12 01:47:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:long term?
Thu Sep 12 01:48:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Bill gates will not go to jail :)
Thu Sep 12 02:36:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it is always good if you can make what you do for one enhance the other
Thu Sep 12 02:36:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops
Thu Sep 12 11:54:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:selfish ass
Thu Sep 12 12:17:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and why would it be?
Thu Sep 12 12:18:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try (: 0 :)
Thu Sep 12 15:11:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any swedes here?
Thu Sep 12 15:57:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we have kidnapped King Gustav and Queen Sylvia!
Thu Sep 12 15:59:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud is not worth any trouble
Thu Sep 12 16:05:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I do not need Washington to prove the copyright
Thu Sep 12 16:05:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops :)
Thu Sep 12 20:43:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grep Ylsrim /lib/*.c
Thu Sep 12 23:42:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to_int()
Thu Sep 12 23:43:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayup
Fri Sep 13 11:29:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Relative Absurdity:Hey, everyone, I changed my mind, you can steal my MudLib all you want.
Fri Sep 13 17:43:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Fri Sep 13 17:44:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first bee is a queen bee who kicks your ass
Fri Sep 13 17:44:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:other bees are workers who do nothing
Fri Sep 13 17:44:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:assuming what a player means could get them killed
Fri Sep 13 17:45:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:players can use aliasing to create short commands that are meaningful to them
Fri Sep 13 17:47:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then alias lb look at first bee
Fri Sep 13 17:47:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the first time you run into the situation, you do not want the mud assuming anything for you
Fri Sep 13 17:48:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is fixed in the next release, but I forget what the fix is
Fri Sep 13 17:49:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the win32 version actually has some more up to date code
Fri Sep 13 17:49:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, IVr2.6 is not yet released
Fri Sep 13 17:51:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not do Nightmare any more, Blitz is in charge of the next release and the future of NM
Fri Sep 13 17:52:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Which sword do you mean will come up only when the user is ambiguous
Fri Sep 13 17:54:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that will not happen
Fri Sep 13 17:54:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Sep 14 11:15:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should not send 8-bit chars over intermud
Sat Sep 14 11:17:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sleepy
Sat Sep 14 11:18:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that sucks
Sat Sep 14 11:18:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's bizarre
Sat Sep 14 11:18:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:niteowl: I hope it helped
Sat Sep 14 11:18:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmmm...
Sat Sep 14 11:19:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think that is a problem with MudOS... it must be stripping 8-bit chars
Sat Sep 14 11:20:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to looks at packages/parser.c
Sat Sep 14 11:21:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specifically, I believe it strips all ^[A-Za-z0-9] characters up to the first one
Mon Sep 16 13:59:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't you mwan AS (Artificial Stupidity)
Mon Sep 16 19:13:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know how to get a Java panel to redraw itself?
Mon Sep 16 19:16:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think that is for things with a graphics conbtext, isn;t it?
Mon Sep 16 19:19:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:repaaint() ain't it,...
Mon Sep 16 19:19:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specifically, I have rows of data
Mon Sep 16 19:19:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which are basically panels in a grid bag layout
Mon Sep 16 19:19:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I allow the user to use the arrow keys to move up and down in focus
Mon Sep 16 19:19:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the panel with focus has a different colour background
Mon Sep 16 19:20:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is that everything is changing except the background colour, unless I do something that forces a redraw, like a resize
Mon Sep 16 19:33:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that does not event work Zakk :) it knows if the sizes are really differenmt
Mon Sep 16 19:34:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Mon Sep 16 19:34:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck yeah
Mon Sep 16 19:34:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am getting desperate
Mon Sep 16 19:34:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:resize(size()) :)
Mon Sep 16 19:37:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... sorta came close to working :)
Mon Sep 16 23:19:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should use the driver that comes with the mudlib
Mon Sep 16 23:20:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is really simple
Mon Sep 16 23:20:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tar -xf nm.tar; cd nm;./Configure
Mon Sep 16 23:20:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nonsense
Mon Sep 16 23:20:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you did not use the Configure program to build your driver
Mon Sep 16 23:21:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the directions do not say use build.mudos, now, do they?
Mon Sep 16 23:22:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you coould not find any directions???
Mon Sep 16 23:22:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one word: bullshit
Mon Sep 16 23:24:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thintercre #1 there are clearly marked directions in the NM package... like README...
Mon Sep 16 23:24:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 without directions, wtf made you do build.mudos?
Mon Sep 16 23:39:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why don't you read the docs that come in the package you downloaded?
Mon Sep 16 23:40:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Mon Sep 16 23:41:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:go fucking figure
Mon Sep 16 23:43:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you did not tellme I am wrong... you told me I am right
Mon Sep 16 23:43:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just said you did not read the doc that tells you how to install the goddamn mud
Mon Sep 16 23:43:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ReleaseNotes.txt is not documentation telling you how to install?
Mon Sep 16 23:45:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, #1 get a real browser
Mon Sep 16 23:45:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:linyz does support frames
Mon Sep 16 23:46:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:enough to avvess the docs
Mon Sep 16 23:46:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and as Drong says, it says everything in those main docs
Mon Sep 16 23:46:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dragon
Mon Sep 16 23:47:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:someone just did not read the damn things
Mon Sep 16 23:49:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 pet peeve of mine: people who do not read the docs I spoent a lot of time writing
Mon Sep 16 23:49:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are there
Mon Sep 16 23:51:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Panther... I do not know what sort of peculiar world you are living in, but those docs are there, and they are very simple
Mon Sep 16 23:51:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you cannot handle the installatin of NM, then you have no business running a mud
Mon Sep 16 23:51:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is one step: ./Configure
Mon Sep 16 23:51:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not rocket science
Mon Sep 16 23:51:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it also says the things that can go wrong and what to do
Mon Sep 16 23:52:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:besides, it says type this... and you typed something else!
Mon Sep 16 23:54:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's odd... tmi-2 is a piece of crap
Mon Sep 16 23:55:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is a really bloody easy install
Mon Sep 16 23:55:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:please tell me why you followed tmi install instructions for NM>
Mon Sep 16 23:55:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you think maybe that might be why NM did not install cleanly for you?
Mon Sep 16 23:57:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wpm?
Mon Sep 16 23:59:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is: to install NM, you have to follow NM directions
Mon Sep 16 23:59:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nm directions are simple: type ./Configure
Tue Sep 17 00:00:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the main thing that can go wrong is that pelr is not in /usr/local/bin, which is covered in the doc
Tue Sep 17 00:00:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is all well covered in the docs
Tue Sep 17 00:00:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course there are not, there is nothing more than that one thing to do
Tue Sep 17 00:01:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what the hell do you want, a book saying "type Configure"
Tue Sep 17 00:01:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does say what can go wrong
Tue Sep 17 00:02:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dragon pointed that out to you
Tue Sep 17 00:03:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:docs telling you what to do are not docs?
Tue Sep 17 00:04:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do there need to be docs on it?
Tue Sep 17 00:05:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you have docs on setup with any software you install?
Tue Sep 17 00:05:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:customizing an install program for a system that is already installed?
Tue Sep 17 00:05:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tmi-2, the system you are praising, does not even have an install routine
Tue Sep 17 00:06:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the installed software is documented on the web
Tue Sep 17 00:06:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if your browser does not support frames, it sucks to be you
Tue Sep 17 00:06:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nothing in the package documentation tells you to read options.h
Tue Sep 17 00:07:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the process is simple: download the package, untar it, read the ReleaseNotes, follow those directions
Tue Sep 17 00:07:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I see Panther... for a product I do for free, you want me to create documentation in zillions of conceivable formats
Tue Sep 17 00:58:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:jesus christ
Tue Sep 17 01:44:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:god, the fucking java.sql.Date class bites fucking donkey balls
Tue Sep 17 01:46:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:advanced database programmers axtually
Tue Sep 17 01:48:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is supposed to handle dates better than java.util.Date
Tue Sep 17 02:00:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who is we?
Tue Sep 17 02:00:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does dynamix do>
Tue Sep 17 02:01:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doing any java shit?
Tue Sep 17 02:02:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on the Internet?
Tue Sep 17 02:03:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am referring to Internet gaming in general, like muds, but more graphical and such
Tue Sep 17 02:03:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, java for PC-based single user games is a bad idea
Tue Sep 17 02:03:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but if you want an internet based game that is platform independent, Java is the way to go
Tue Sep 17 19:39:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does anyone here have a life?
Tue Sep 17 21:42:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare runs
Tue Sep 17 21:42:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare loads, Nightmare has virtual rooms servers
Tue Sep 17 21:42:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and hell, I just might stop letting people use NM soon
Tue Sep 17 21:43:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:same license goes for lima
Tue Sep 17 21:43:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:worded differently
Tue Sep 17 21:44:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I do the windows support for it
Tue Sep 17 22:20:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who here has read the telnet RFC?
Tue Sep 17 22:21:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bout telnet
Wed Sep 18 11:42:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the win32 Nightmare program is mudos for windows compiled as a GUI application for the NM mudlib
Wed Sep 18 11:44:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what bullshit you are trying to produce Xavier
Wed Sep 18 11:45:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 18 11:45:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Xavier: I do understand your first asshole comment
Wed Sep 18 11:46:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the win32 program allows you to start and configure the mud from a window
Wed Sep 18 11:48:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would that make it unstable?
Wed Sep 18 11:48:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:win32 is perfectly stable
Wed Sep 18 11:50:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are a million things on this earth to criticize microsoft for... I always wonder why techno geeks like to use Windows, which is perhaps the most useable PC OS out there for the general public, as a target with so many other valid targets out there
Wed Sep 18 11:51:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:windows does not crash the most
Wed Sep 18 11:51:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at leats not windows95/windowsNT
Wed Sep 18 11:53:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most people have the 8 MB required to run windws95
Wed Sep 18 11:53:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially sicne most machines ship with at least 16 these days
Wed Sep 18 11:53:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and RAM is cheap
Wed Sep 18 11:55:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM and all LPC is platform independent
Wed Sep 18 11:56:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Maddy: how many operating systems out there do not require 8 MB?
Wed Sep 18 11:56:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:DOS
Wed Sep 18 11:57:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, without X-windowing, you don';t have a coparison
Wed Sep 18 11:57:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, now run real programs on amigaOS
Wed Sep 18 11:57:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:DOH!
Wed Sep 18 12:01:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where do you get that idea Passenger?
Wed Sep 18 12:02:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has nothing to do with win32
Wed Sep 18 12:02:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM is platform independent
Wed Sep 18 12:03:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC is platform independent
Wed Sep 18 12:04:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 18 12:04:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I quit the NM lib, Blitz and Rush have been developing it feverishly
Wed Sep 18 12:15:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the number of verbs in NM does notmake the mud crash :)
Wed Sep 18 12:16:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, some are, that is beta :)
Wed Sep 18 12:18:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 18 12:18:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but in a development mud, you dpo not need a quick fix for that probem\
Wed Sep 18 12:20:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be a huge mistake
Wed Sep 18 12:20:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot pissibly have a mud ready for players yet :_)
Wed Sep 18 12:21:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you do not download a mudlib and declare yourself open :)
Wed Sep 18 12:21:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to have at lkeast half a dozen decent sized areas
Wed Sep 18 12:22:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh
Wed Sep 18 12:22:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the crashes are not that bad... NM runs fine on that system
Wed Sep 18 12:25:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:upgrade your driver, read the changelogs, and make the mudlib changes yourself then :)
Wed Sep 18 12:30:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with no races orclasses?
Wed Sep 18 12:31:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't think that would be a good idea
Wed Sep 18 15:17:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update /lib/*.c will never work, at least rarely
Wed Sep 18 15:17:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if A inherits B, and I update A.c then B.c, it does no good
Wed Sep 18 15:18:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no beyond... not if it is 10 levels deep
Wed Sep 18 15:18:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you probably have to do it 100 times to guarantee it... but I am no statistics expert'
Wed Sep 18 15:19:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, I will take your word for it :)
Wed Sep 18 21:13:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make money?
Wed Sep 18 21:17:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetRestrictLimbs()
Thu Sep 19 09:45:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:same difference
Thu Sep 19 19:51:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there with experience porting I3 to non LPC systems?
Thu Sep 19 20:11:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one out there pdone the I3 port for a non-MudOS system????
Thu Sep 19 20:12:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the format of a packet being sent?
Thu Sep 19 20:12:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have: length + \0 + string
Thu Sep 19 20:12:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is the string null terminated?
Thu Sep 19 20:13:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie... I will give that a tru :)
Thu Sep 19 20:14:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool... that worked!
Thu Sep 19 20:14:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:excepted it crashed visual cafe :)
Thu Sep 19 20:17:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks!
Thu Sep 19 20:39:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not necessarily... some muds use a setup() construct
Thu Sep 19 20:39:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a headache and am slow today :)
Thu Sep 19 20:40:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mine is right behind my right eye :(
Fri Sep 20 10:33:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does the mudlib gets sent out as one huge fucking packet?
Fri Sep 20 10:36:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are kidding, right?
Fri Sep 20 10:36:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:packet aas in thing sent across the network
Fri Sep 20 10:36:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops
Fri Sep 20 10:36:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudlist, not mudlib
Fri Sep 20 10:37:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I typed wrong
Fri Sep 20 10:39:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does anyone have an answer to my question>
Fri Sep 20 10:46:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is there anyone on this line who has a clue about I3?
Fri Sep 20 10:54:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks Brainstorm, I did not see that in the flurry of nonsense on the screen
Fri Sep 20 10:56:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am running out of memory processing the mudlist :(
Fri Sep 20 10:57:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sends out the whole thing, which is huge, then your program has to process it recursively if it no speak LPC
Fri Sep 20 11:00:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the list should be sent out in pieces under any circumstances
Fri Sep 20 11:11:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is a storage item if it is not a containeer?
Fri Sep 20 11:15:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when it generates one type, those it generates should inherit that type
Fri Sep 20 11:16:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you inherit a storage object, that means you are making a container
Fri Sep 20 11:16:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the essence of what it is to be LIB_STORAGE
Fri Sep 20 11:19:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you want a generator object that creates other objects right?
Fri Sep 20 11:21:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just build that into your monsters
Fri Sep 20 11:21:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but why are you trying to clone the obgen?
Fri Sep 20 11:22:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the obgen is the generator, not the object being generated
Fri Sep 20 11:34:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is SetInventory()
Fri Sep 20 11:34:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot read your home dir
Fri Sep 20 11:37:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it is that way in your read.cfg or write.cfg
Fri Sep 20 12:15:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Fri Sep 20 12:15:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or maybe I do not understand the question
Fri Sep 20 15:40:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know why I might receive incomplete mudmode packets from I3?
Fri Sep 20 16:47:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bing
Fri Sep 20 17:00:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:curious... MudOS is sending me a packet it claims is 808 MB
Fri Sep 20 17:01:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, this is Java
Fri Sep 20 17:02:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do cookies have to do with anything?
Fri Sep 20 17:02:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sending and receiving plenty of packets fine...
Fri Sep 20 17:03:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every now and then, however, it wabts me to allocate a big honking chunk of ram
Fri Sep 20 17:05:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a packet I am gettng from mudos
Fri Sep 20 17:06:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is not the same packet every time
Fri Sep 20 17:07:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:4
Fri Sep 20 17:07:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is aa Java int
Fri Sep 20 17:08:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think actually the3 problem i that mudos sends me an incomplete packet
Fri Sep 20 17:08:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:definitely something different each time...
Fri Sep 20 17:09:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do: len = input.readInt();
Fri Sep 20 17:09:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:input.read(buffer)
Fri Sep 20 17:09:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Fri Sep 20 17:10:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however... I think it is because mudos does...
Fri Sep 20 17:10:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:packet:x + incomplete_packet
Fri Sep 20 17:10:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then read the rest of incomplete packet...
Fri Sep 20 17:11:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which thinks that is the size for the next packet
Fri Sep 20 17:11:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, but I think Java is supposed to
Fri Sep 20 17:11:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:block until all bytes are read
Fri Sep 20 17:12:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lemme checkl
Fri Sep 20 17:13:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, slap me silly... it blocks until *some* data is ready
Fri Sep 20 17:15:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java does... DataInputStream.readFully()
Fri Sep 20 17:16:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why>
Fri Sep 20 17:17:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everything I/O in Java can be done as either a data input stream or data output stream
Fri Sep 20 17:17:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:socket I/O, file I/O, etc.
Fri Sep 20 17:20:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right...
Fri Sep 20 17:21:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it knows the size of byte[]
Fri Sep 20 17:22:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool... everything seems to be working peachy
Fri Sep 20 17:23:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, now to add support for intermud services
Fri Sep 20 17:23:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks for your help all!
Fri Sep 20 17:25:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a mud driver
Fri Sep 20 17:25:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and a mudlib
Fri Sep 20 17:25:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and a client
Fri Sep 20 17:29:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a problem with I3 is neither basic or early
Fri Sep 20 17:29:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it resulted from me misreading the DataInputStream API
Fri Sep 20 17:30:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hell, I misread shit all the time :)
Fri Sep 20 17:42:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one annouying thing is mudos' lack of null
Fri Sep 20 18:17:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are 50 channels out there :)
Fri Sep 20 19:50:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not testing sending :)
Fri Sep 20 19:52:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test again
Fri Sep 20 19:58:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what emacs is for
Fri Sep 20 20:02:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:emacs runs on win95
Fri Sep 20 20:02:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yes, it also allows you to pick the editor
Fri Sep 20 20:04:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:forgot where I got it... I think on some wbe site
Fri Sep 20 20:06:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Fri Sep 20 20:06:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ugh... why won't this work!!!???!!
Fri Sep 20 20:07:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops, it does work :)
Fri Sep 20 20:18:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test again
Fri Sep 20 21:21:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bing
Fri Sep 20 21:21:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Fri Sep 20 21:22:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::) just testing reception on another mud, thanks anyways though :)
Fri Sep 20 21:40:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Fri Sep 20 23:38:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bing
Fri Sep 20 23:40:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud is fucking net-nasty
Fri Sep 20 23:41:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I am actuall y looking at the traffic
Fri Sep 20 23:42:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not compared to downloading gifs, but way much more than you wanted devoted to this claptrap
Fri Sep 20 23:42:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the mudlist that sucks
Fri Sep 20 23:43:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks for the advice duuksaryth
Fri Sep 20 23:43:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I will come to you when I need useless advice in the future
Fri Sep 20 23:45:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people who choose long difficult to spell names do not lecture others on spelling them
Fri Sep 20 23:48:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me get this straight... I point out some problems with I3 and Duukie boy is lecturing me?
Fri Sep 20 23:49:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what a twit
Fri Sep 20 23:50:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that was in reply to a rude comment about me getting my mud off the I3
Fri Sep 20 23:51:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, sorry about the rpely
Fri Sep 20 23:55:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rwho works fine wwith NM
Fri Sep 20 23:55:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just take out the line that says it doesn't
Fri Sep 20 23:55:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am writng rwho in Java
Fri Sep 20 23:56:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my mud is not receiving rwho requests
Fri Sep 20 23:57:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it cannot respond because it is not receiving the request
Fri Sep 20 23:57:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayup
Fri Sep 20 23:58:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand how it could not receive rwho
Fri Sep 20 23:58:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is receving every single channel packet
Fri Sep 20 23:58:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I have it set up so if I am unaware of a packet type, it is getting printed to stdout
Sat Sep 21 00:02:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which rwho
Sat Sep 21 00:03:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:'which rwho'
Sat Sep 21 00:10:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Sat Sep 21 00:13:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I receive channel stuff, locate stuff, mudlist, channel list
Sat Sep 21 00:13:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just not rwho
Sat Sep 21 00:15:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm
Sat Sep 21 00:16:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Sat Sep 21 00:17:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry about the tests... I keep checking to see if the thing hit a break point on me wihhout me knowing it :)
Sat Sep 21 00:17:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:javamud
Sat Sep 21 00:18:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not receiving
Sat Sep 21 00:21:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just recived a rwho form someone
Sat Sep 21 00:40:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Sat Sep 21 00:40:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:parsing mud mode in Java is slow
Sat Sep 21 00:40:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am still not receiving all rwho requests
Sat Sep 21 00:41:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to-date, I have received one
Sat Sep 21 00:42:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:holy shit... suddenly it worked fine
Sat Sep 21 00:42:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though the idle times are a bit off :)
Sat Sep 21 00:42:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just for the record, I did not change any code...
Sat Sep 21 00:43:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep zakk... I have been on the mudlist here the wholetime
Sat Sep 21 00:43:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said... I did not change ANY code
Sat Sep 21 00:44:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just restarted the server outside of cafe
Sat Sep 21 00:44:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh... I bet that is it...
Sat Sep 21 00:44:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:th
Sat Sep 21 00:44:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:testmud was a name I was using yesterday
Sat Sep 21 00:45:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:evidently the router is not recognizing dirty shutdowns
Sat Sep 21 00:46:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, all mudlist info from javamud goes  into a relational database, so if you every need a buizarre mudlist query, let me know :)
Sat Sep 21 00:48:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you know one thing totally lame... the java date class has no way of returning the time difference between two date objects/...
Sat Sep 21 00:49:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not that I see...
Sat Sep 21 00:49:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the bizarre idle times are because I do now.getTime() - date.,getTime()
Sat Sep 21 00:49:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which provides a long :)
Sat Sep 21 00:50:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and is not exactly as easy as date.timeDiff(other_date)
Sat Sep 21 00:50:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the I3 Java support is almost ready...
Sat Sep 21 00:50:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I have basic mud objects working, as well is user output
Sat Sep 21 00:51:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now I can see all of the channel messages on javamud, just cabnnot send any :)
Sat Sep 21 00:59:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Java string class is really anemic too
Sat Sep 21 01:00:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no capitalize() method
Sat Sep 21 01:01:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:win95 is as good as any
Sat Sep 21 01:06:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how complex to do command parsing for a first version...
Sat Sep 21 11:38:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you want eventMove()
Sat Sep 21 11:39:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, not event that, use SetInventory()
Sat Sep 21 11:40:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh
Sat Sep 21 11:41:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eventMove()
Sat Sep 21 11:53:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:won't it be cool when we have commercial muds on I3!
Sat Sep 21 11:57:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one has to pay to use it :)
Sat Sep 21 12:38:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that'll stop em!
Sat Sep 21 12:40:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:12 is fucking stupid
Sat Sep 21 12:41:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no 12 year old is ready for sex
Sat Sep 21 12:41:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would agree with that Leto
Sat Sep 21 12:41:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but 12 year olds having sex is bad
Sat Sep 21 12:42:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NOT
Sat Sep 21 12:43:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the IS we believe that a 12 year old does not have the capcity to make that decision
Sat Sep 21 12:44:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is nonsense Leto
Sat Sep 21 12:44:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mostinsane thing in the US is drinking laws
Sat Sep 21 12:44:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and car rental... but that is not a law
Sat Sep 21 12:44:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:police will not do anything with respect to a 20 year old
Sat Sep 21 12:45:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make subdirs in /save/kills
Sat Sep 21 12:45:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know
Sat Sep 21 12:45:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only things a 20 yeard old cannot do is drink and rent cars
Sat Sep 21 12:46:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and run for president
Sat Sep 21 12:46:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:21
Sat Sep 21 13:22:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Sep 21 13:22:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mission critical client/server systems
Sat Sep 21 13:23:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Inbgres, Oracle, Sybase backends mostly
Sat Sep 21 13:24:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, we are in the middle of setting up our web pages
Sat Sep 21 13:24:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where are you located blue?
Sat Sep 21 13:24:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Leto: the thing with the web pages is a major beef I have with my company... took them way too long to egt to the point we are at now :)
Sat Sep 21 13:25:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Blue: is this remote work? on site in London? or a combination?
Sat Sep 21 13:25:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lemme login to eath... probably should not be bothering igossip people with this :)
Sat Sep 21 13:32:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, you make those subdirs I told you about
Sat Sep 21 17:07:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nothing like patronizing microshit for no reason
Sat Sep 21 17:07:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:neither browser offers anything major over the other
Sat Sep 21 18:49:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Sat Sep 21 18:49:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:testing reception on Javamud though :)
Sat Sep 21 18:54:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:give me 40 so I can have 80
Sat Sep 21 18:56:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :) still not quite as impressive as MudOS though :)
Sat Sep 21 18:56:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just has intermud and the ability to login
Sat Sep 21 18:56:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, parsing the intermu dmudlist suckls, but that is not fair since I am parsing LPC in Java to do that
Sat Sep 21 18:57:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with respect to the rest, speed is fine now, but it is not doing much
Sat Sep 21 18:58:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not sure what you mean? you mean client as in the client of the mud>?
Sat Sep 21 18:58:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it means I am ahead of my editor right now :)
Sat Sep 21 18:59:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes... that is my long term intention
Sat Sep 21 18:59:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now, though, it has a simple character interface
Sat Sep 21 18:59:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not even telnet negotiation... straight text
Sat Sep 21 18:59:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eventually, however, the entiore system will be distributed
Sat Sep 21 19:00:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you working on distributed Java mudding?
Sat Sep 21 19:01:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh... I thought you meant *you* were a head of me :)
Sat Sep 21 19:02:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the loong term idea is that cres no longer have their own home dirs... their areas are located on their own machines
Sat Sep 21 19:02:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in addition, the client will take part in a lot of the user related processing
Sat Sep 21 19:03:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it also uses a database for persistence, rather than some home brewed thing like LPMuds do
Sat Sep 21 19:03:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as a matter of fact, it is storing its mudlist in a database now :)
Sat Sep 21 19:04:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh well, back to work :)
Sat Sep 21 20:49:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bing
Sat Sep 21 20:50:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:bong
Sat Sep 21 20:51:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:test
Sat Sep 21 21:18:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is like C++
Sat Sep 21 21:18:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you should try Java then :)
Sat Sep 21 21:19:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I think I need a name better than JavaMud for this place
Sat Sep 21 21:19:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Java is a bit like LPC, nothing like HTML
Sat Sep 21 21:19:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I wrote me a mud :)
Sat Sep 21 21:20:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud::)
Sat Sep 21 21:20:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it will be playable from a browser
Sat Sep 21 21:20:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:JavaMud is 100% Java... no LPC
Sat Sep 21 21:21:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:check out mu spider applet
Sat Sep 21 21:21:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:hmm...or maybe it is the film applet...
Sat Sep 21 21:21:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I think one of those waits on the image
Sat Sep 21 21:22:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no, this has no compatibility or relationship to existing muds
Sat Sep 21 21:22:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:thanks R'aaaza
Sat Sep 21 21:22:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:right now the front end is telnet
Sat Sep 21 21:22:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I am working on the server portiobn
Sat Sep 21 21:25:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Javamud uses a sql backend
Sat Sep 21 21:25:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:visual cafe
Sat Sep 21 21:28:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:SW?
Sat Sep 21 21:29:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:got to cafe.symantec.com and download VisualCafe
Sat Sep 21 21:30:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:VisualCafe, which is what you want anyways
Sat Sep 21 21:32:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:what is the question?
Sat Sep 21 21:33:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes, have the room have a function for its long
Sat Sep 21 21:33:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:then query the door's status in your room long
Sat Sep 21 21:34:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:bad idea to stick it in the lib... you do not know which exits a cre wants to show up in the room as such
Sat Sep 21 21:34:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:oh, the solours thing is cool
Sat Sep 21 22:15:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:woo woo! I know have 4 commands instead of 2!
Sat Sep 21 22:17:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:intercode, look, say, and quit
Sat Sep 21 22:17:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:quitting is problematic as silly as it seems
Sat Sep 21 22:18:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:there will be more thann one room
Sat Sep 21 22:20:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Sep 21 22:21:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is a completely different project
Sat Sep 21 22:24:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on sparc and Visual Cafe on win95
Sat Sep 21 22:34:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:test
Sat Sep 21 22:35:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:here?
Sat Sep 21 22:36:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I had just said something
Sat Sep 21 22:46:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:boing
Sat Sep 21 23:17:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:hmm
Sat Sep 21 23:24:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:why would you do that?
Sat Sep 21 23:24:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:a door is a separate object
Sat Sep 21 23:25:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:NM used to do it s data inside a room
Sat Sep 21 23:25:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:but a door is an object
Sat Sep 21 23:25:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:and things only really profunction right when you treat it as such
Sat Sep 21 23:26:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:NM doors are one of the slicker pieces of the mudlib, IMHO
Sun Sep 22 11:06:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:better
Sun Sep 22 11:06:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:mSQL may be free, but it is damn flakey
Sun Sep 22 11:08:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:free if you are running  a free mud :)
Sun Sep 22 11:10:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:these are test systems I am building... no need to think up useful names
Sun Sep 22 11:11:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I think I am going to switc to Oracle
Sun Sep 22 13:02:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:'
Sun Sep 22 13:03:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err `
Sun Sep 22 14:10:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means the owner of your function pointer was destructed
Sun Sep 22 14:10:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the driver has no business knowing about light
Sun Sep 22 14:13:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a real problem
Sun Sep 22 14:14:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean they are errors that affect nothing
Sun Sep 22 14:16:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, check for destructed funtion pointer owners at the calls then
Sun Sep 22 14:17:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it probably does
Sun Sep 22 14:20:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it says in the options.h it is memory expensive
Sun Sep 22 14:20:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:magnifix, there is no magic fix
Sun Sep 22 14:21:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a problem
Sun Sep 22 14:21:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can fix it, but it means introducing a bunch of extra code whose sole function is to make your error log look pretty
Sun Sep 22 14:23:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem, like I saidbefore, is that you are calling a function pointer whose owner is destructed
Sun Sep 22 14:24:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then??
Sun Sep 22 14:25:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the problem is not that this_object() does not exist
Sun Sep 22 14:25:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is that call outs are not being removed in some places, and in other places the return value of functiionp is not being checked
Sun Sep 22 14:29:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not an inconsistency, and it is not one error
Sun Sep 22 14:29:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, and they are not really errors
Sun Sep 22 14:30:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, a login has a call out that idles out the login
Sun Sep 22 14:30:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when you login properly...
Sun Sep 22 14:30:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the login object is destroyed, but the call out exists
Sun Sep 22 14:31:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:until the latest release of mudos, there was nothing you could do aout that
Sun Sep 22 14:31:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the call out would be attempted, and it would note that as an error
Sun Sep 22 14:31:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you can avoid that now by tracking the call out handle and removing the call out in the destruct
Sun Sep 22 14:32:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Geldron
Sun Sep 22 14:32:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Magnifix that has nothing to do with this
Sun Sep 22 14:34:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for that one situation, yes, you could
Sun Sep 22 14:34:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that is one thing
Sun Sep 22 14:34:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are a bunch of places where call outs are dangling, or function pointers are triuggered
Sun Sep 22 14:45:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Sep 22 14:58:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:test
Sun Sep 22 14:59:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:that's the name, don't wear it out :)
Sun Sep 22 15:00:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I can receive tells... but sending tells is still kinda goofy
Sun Sep 22 15:03:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:bugger
Sun Sep 22 15:06:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:that depends on what you mean
Sun Sep 22 15:06:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:do you mean create the infrastructure? that is hard
Sun Sep 22 15:07:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:given an equivalent infrastructure, it is just as easy as LPMuds
Sun Sep 22 15:18:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes, java is multithreading
Sun Sep 22 15:19:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:if you are using NM or Lima, DO NOT USE add_action()
Sun Sep 22 15:19:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Lima will not allow it, and NM does not like it
Sun Sep 22 15:20:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it depends what you are threading
Sun Sep 22 15:20:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the server won't let you thread stupid stuff... it locks down its core thread while executing
Sun Sep 22 15:21:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes, my driver multithreads a lot of stuff.. garbage collection, network communication
Sun Sep 22 15:22:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:especially given that he works with Lima
Sun Sep 22 15:22:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no LPMud driver multithreads
Sun Sep 22 15:23:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I will release binraries, I will not release source code
Sun Sep 22 15:24:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no, I refuse to release source code for stuff to people ever again
Sun Sep 22 15:24:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:they can have at it :)
Sun Sep 22 15:25:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:my Java code is actually very clean :)
Sun Sep 22 15:25:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:holding source code does not prevent whining :)
Sun Sep 22 15:26:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it does prevent people from modifying two lines of code and claiming credit for the whole thing
Sun Sep 22 15:26:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:not at all
Sun Sep 22 15:26:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:everyone out there who has modified the MudOS source, raise your hands
Sun Sep 22 15:27:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:people don't modify driver source in general
Sun Sep 22 15:27:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:hell, most people barely know how to compile it
Sun Sep 22 15:28:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is easier to read well written driver API docs than read source code though
Sun Sep 22 15:28:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:there is still you do it in your mudlib area
Sun Sep 22 15:29:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the API docs tell you all you need to know
Sun Sep 22 15:29:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:well, why don't you write your own java mud then :)
Sun Sep 22 15:30:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:my Java driver will bve useful to 90% of the mud builders out there, probably more
Sun Sep 22 15:31:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:and instaead of people who think they are driver hacks, modify two lines, and call it theirs doing that
Sun Sep 22 15:31:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I force them to put their money where their mouth is and build their own
Sun Sep 22 15:32:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I think I have earned that cyncism
Sun Sep 22 15:34:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:mudlib
Sun Sep 22 15:34:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the core lib I am building though handles those
Sun Sep 22 15:35:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I know you do not NEED to
Sun Sep 22 15:35:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:but it does make logical sense
Sun Sep 22 15:36:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes Syntax
Sun Sep 22 15:38:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:not at this time, and I do not know that it ever will... I do not think the Java language supports that
Sun Sep 22 15:38:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you can create new files and compile thenm on the fly
Sun Sep 22 15:38:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you cannot update them
Sun Sep 22 15:39:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:which I do not think Java allows
Sun Sep 22 15:39:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:my guess is you would get class verification exceptions
Sun Sep 22 15:40:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is capable of a much more robust persistence model than DGD
Sun Sep 22 15:41:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:my Java mud uses a relational database for object persistence
Sun Sep 22 15:41:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:right
Sun Sep 22 15:41:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:but you definitely can add on the fly
Sun Sep 22 15:41:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:which is more important
Sun Sep 22 15:42:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:this is being built on the model that you have your running mud which has tested code, and a test mud where you develop new code
Sun Sep 22 15:42:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is a cool feature of LPC, but in a well developed system, it is not important, no
Sun Sep 22 15:43:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:additions to any running system should be controled
Sun Sep 22 15:43:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:remember, this is Java, you can afford to run two muds since you can run them on your home windows box
Sun Sep 22 15:43:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:one of the reasons quality on LPMuds is so low is people can add horrid code to them willy nilly and fix them whule it is running :)
Sun Sep 22 15:44:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Java speed for me is fine on win95
Sun Sep 22 15:45:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:use something else
Sun Sep 22 15:45:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the point is everyone can have a test copy of their mud on their home PC for development
Sun Sep 22 15:45:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is not like LPC where you have a hard time getting a real site, much less a test site
Sun Sep 22 15:46:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Tim: it is the ability to easily add to the mud... I am not changing that model
Sun Sep 22 15:48:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the model for Javamud is you build in the encironment most confortable to you
Sun Sep 22 15:48:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:mac, windows, unix, whatever
Sun Sep 22 15:48:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:then submit your areas for approval (which is the case ofr any real LPMud as well)(
Sun Sep 22 15:49:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:gotta look at the real workflow, not the cool bells and whistles
Sun Sep 22 15:49:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no, you can run the mudlib remote
Sun Sep 22 15:49:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you can run against the same mudlib in a different virtual machine
Sun Sep 22 15:49:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:or better, against your own mudlib while offline
Sun Sep 22 15:50:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:sieni: you allow any cre to will nilly stick new code in a running game?
Sun Sep 22 15:51:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I do not know off any quality muds that allow that
Sun Sep 22 15:51:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no, it is actually ideal for them
Sun Sep 22 15:52:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:they build their areas in a way that is convenient for them
Sun Sep 22 15:52:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:then they submit those areas to approval who adds them
Sun Sep 22 15:52:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the same way things happen on NM and Igor and Phoenix and Synergy and other muds I have worked with
Sun Sep 22 15:53:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the only difference is that it puts a little bit of approcal responsibility on the mud
Sun Sep 22 15:53:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you do not need a local copy of the mud
Sun Sep 22 15:54:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Java does not care where source code exists on the network
Sun Sep 22 15:55:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the same way applets work
Sun Sep 22 15:55:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:well, then you do bring the mudlib onto your local machine
Sun Sep 22 15:55:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:duh
Sun Sep 22 15:56:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:if you want to code offline, you need a copy of your mudlib... just like you do with any other mud type
Sun Sep 22 15:56:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes it does... because using your own environment to code and test without the mudlib is not possible with LPC
Sun Sep 22 15:57:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes Ciao
Sun Sep 22 15:57:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it also will allow the cre to keep their .class files on their machien if they have a permanent connection
Sun Sep 22 15:58:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:a URL
Sun Sep 22 15:58:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you can compile against remote ly located clasees
Sun Sep 22 15:58:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I would like to see distributed cre areas
Sun Sep 22 15:59:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:but that is down the road
Sun Sep 22 15:59:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Leto: the real thing sucks
Sun Sep 22 15:59:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:because the real thing imposes an environment on you
Sun Sep 22 15:59:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes Ciao
Sun Sep 22 15:59:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is not that bad Leto...
Sun Sep 22 16:00:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:and I am working on the desgn for it... I just need to handle the secfurity issues
Sun Sep 22 16:00:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Leto: security is related to applets
Sun Sep 22 16:00:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I will write my own security manager
Sun Sep 22 16:01:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it could allow your mud to be huge
Sun Sep 22 16:01:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes Leto,. but that is completely different
Sun Sep 22 16:01:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:that has nothing to do with security for distributed apps
Sun Sep 22 16:03:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:at any rate, I do have a plan to make this thing kick LPC ass :)
Sun Sep 22 16:03:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:hell no
Sun Sep 22 16:04:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:bodies?
Sun Sep 22 16:04:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:bodies are not a complex issue
Sun Sep 22 16:07:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the JavaMud concept puts more em[phasis on writing quality areas than controlling muds
Sun Sep 22 16:08:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:at any rate, I need to run :) see ya!
Sun Sep 22 16:23:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:.b files rightnow are flakey within the same mud on the same machine
Sun Sep 22 16:24:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:took a shower
Sun Sep 22 16:26:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:err, it would not work
Sun Sep 22 16:26:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the driver would try to reload
Sun Sep 22 22:17:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:bing
Sun Sep 22 22:32:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why is that stupid?
Sun Sep 22 22:33:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmmm good point
Sun Sep 22 22:33:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:"because it is"
Sun Sep 22 22:34:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never heard anyone say they have a problem with Lima
Sun Sep 22 22:35:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I heard Zakk make a pot shot at Zakk
Sun Sep 22 22:35:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err at NM
Sun Sep 22 22:35:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the incluided driver with NM is just a different version of the one with Lima :)
Sun Sep 22 22:37:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't touch the makefile
Sun Sep 22 22:37:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the fault of mudos of that version
Sun Sep 22 22:38:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you take the options.h from the NM lib...
Sun Sep 22 22:38:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err local_options
Sun Sep 22 22:39:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you would just want to download the driver v22b13 though
Sun Sep 22 22:39:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm.... though there are smne driver changes to error logging that are only in the windows version of NM yet
Sun Sep 22 22:39:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you like Lima and are happy with it, there is no reaosn to change
Sun Sep 22 22:40:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?
Sun Sep 22 22:40:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:WinMudOS is just like Unix mudos, except with a simpler interface
Sun Sep 22 22:41:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:windows works quite well for most of the population
Sun Sep 22 22:41:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it runs a mud very well too
Sun Sep 22 22:42:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, NM has the error handling changes on the windows version since the windows version is using the latest driver :)
Sun Sep 22 22:44:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Fathom... MS designed windows to crash
Sun Sep 22 22:45:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they thought to themselves... gosh, if we make software that is completely useless, people will buy it
Sun Sep 22 22:47:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Fathom that is a clearly unusual occurence
Sun Sep 22 22:47:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can take anecdotal catstrophic stories from any OS
Sun Sep 22 22:48:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably you deleted kerl32.dll or whatever
Sun Sep 22 22:48:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Fathom: sounds liek you have no clue how to run your windows system
Sun Sep 22 22:49:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do this on your linux box: rm /vmlinuz
Sun Sep 22 22:49:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:same difference as your notepad problem
Sun Sep 22 22:49:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trying to swap out with no HD space is an illegal operation
Sun Sep 22 22:49:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:name one OS that will not complain about running out of HD space
Sun Sep 22 22:50:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who gives a fuck which program was running?
Sun Sep 22 22:50:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you would have gotten a similar message on UNIX or any other OS
Sun Sep 22 22:51:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it did
Sun Sep 22 22:52:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to netscape, it ran out of physical memory
Sun Sep 22 22:52:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Fathom: your point is that somehow some other OS magically handles this
Sun Sep 22 22:52:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would like to know which magial OS this is
Sun Sep 22 22:54:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry you wasted my time with it when I was tryign to help you
Sun Sep 22 23:03:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, MudOS supports that... but rarely can anyone read that code
Sun Sep 22 23:03:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:foreach() rocks
Sun Sep 22 23:04:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err foreach() rocks
Sun Sep 22 23:04:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:foreach(int x in string) foreach( element in array) foreach(key, value in mapping)
Sun Sep 22 23:08:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how about users()->foo()
Sun Sep 22 23:09:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call other accepts either an array of obejcts or an object as arg 1
Sun Sep 22 23:10:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Fathom: if we all decided we hated your ass, you could be gone in a second
Sun Sep 22 23:10:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:freedom of speech dbe damned
Sun Sep 22 23:10:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, it is more sinister than that
Sun Sep 22 23:10:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zakk or I could act on our own and do it
Sun Sep 22 23:10:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Fathom: shows how much you know about intermud
Sun Sep 22 23:12:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not exercising a freedom of speech then Fathom... that is exercising your right to be a complete asshole
Sun Sep 22 23:12:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:5 connections oooohhh... I am shivering
Sun Sep 22 23:14:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gosh! he has 5 sites!
Sun Sep 22 23:14:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err 4]
Sun Sep 22 23:14:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err 3
Sun Sep 22 23:15:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't run an ISP
Sun Sep 22 23:15:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ISP for friends?
Sun Sep 22 23:17:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:cool, tell works :)
Sun Sep 22 23:18:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:when you start from scarratch, the little things get you excited :)
Sun Sep 22 23:19:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I will in a minute,,, incoming packets here take a few minutes to get rolling because the latency involved with LPC->Java mudlist translation
Sun Sep 22 23:19:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:outgoing Intermud is ain a different thread, so it is not blocked
Sun Sep 22 23:20:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:a what?
Sun Sep 22 23:20:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:oh, hah a , I get it
Sun Sep 22 23:21:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, should be GetName()
Sun Sep 22 23:22:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, GetName()
Sun Sep 22 23:22:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people areinvis for a reason generally
Sun Sep 22 23:23:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never got the tell

Sun Sep 22 23:24:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no... the windows one has some mods because it uses a latter driver
Sun Sep 22 23:24:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:they would be the same if they were for the same mudos version
Sun Sep 22 23:25:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:in other words, the windows version is the one that would be released with a unix v22b13 version
Sun Sep 22 23:25:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I refuse to do coffee
Sun Sep 22 23:26:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:dos? winsock? you are speaking a foreign language to me
Sun Sep 22 23:27:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:why would anyone work on anything dos based
Sun Sep 22 23:28:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no
Sun Sep 22 23:28:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is a wind95 application
Sun Sep 22 23:29:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the mudos for windows thing IS A WINDOWS APP
Sun Sep 22 23:30:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you click on the little mudos icon, up pops a window with a set of menus... you click Driver|Configure and set up your mud, Driver|Start and away it goes
Sun Sep 22 23:31:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:MudOS was originally written in C
Sun Sep 22 23:31:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I ported it to C++ :)
Sun Sep 22 23:32:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:"test"
Sun Sep 22 23:32:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I have not released the source code yet
Sun Sep 22 23:33:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:correct
Sun Sep 22 23:33:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it sucked
Sun Sep 22 23:34:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no
Sun Sep 22 23:35:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it will never be merged in with themain mudos
Sun Sep 22 23:35:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is windows specific and will develop in parallel to mudos
Sun Sep 22 23:35:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I use MFC
Sun Sep 22 23:35:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:remember, it has windows
Sun Sep 22 23:35:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:my code would be a NM to make platform independent
Sun Sep 22 23:36:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:oh well... I need to go to bed
Sun Sep 22 23:36:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:probably, I will not... I might be back in 5 minuites

Mon Sep 23 15:15:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does Lima have night and day?
Mon Sep 23 15:38:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you have only a finite number of levels
Mon Sep 23 15:38:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what happens when someone reaches the last level?
Mon Sep 23 15:39:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, NM does nt have exp anyways :)
Mon Sep 23 15:40:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea how lima's system works
Mon Sep 23 15:44:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does have levels.... exp != levels
Mon Sep 23 15:45:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yep, it does
Mon Sep 23 15:45:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:challenge???
Mon Sep 23 15:45:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why should your wiggle skill advance if you have never wiggled?
Mon Sep 23 15:46:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, play quake where the monsters are gross!
Mon Sep 23 15:58:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM's system allows you to specifically sit around and train in a given skill
Mon Sep 23 15:59:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then what fun is the mud if you do that?
Mon Sep 23 15:59:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would yyou have a robot play a game fo royu?
Mon Sep 23 15:59:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doesn;t that sorta stink of stupidity?
Mon Sep 23 16:01:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:aragorn just suggested a mud where you can press a button and double your exp
Mon Sep 23 16:01:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think it would be a smashing success
Mon Sep 23 16:01:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:watch all of the people hitting the 10 exp button next to the 100 exp one :)
Mon Sep 23 16:04:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yeehaw, locate works

Mon Sep 23 17:02:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the connection between europe and america sucks

Mon Sep 23 17:07:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have to find a physical connection here
Mon Sep 23 17:07:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or are you a fucking moron?
Mon Sep 23 17:08:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, please, lecture me on philosophy
Mon Sep 23 17:09:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tell me, how does Discourse tell us how to connect a machine to a physical link 3000 miles away
Mon Sep 23 17:10:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:machine here
Mon Sep 23 17:10:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:machine there

Mon Sep 23 17:12:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I see...
Mon Sep 23 17:12:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the fact that most archives have european and north american locations has nothing to do with this?
Mon Sep 23 17:13:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Descartes did not write in french dipshit
Mon Sep 23 17:15:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just because you have an edition in french, does not help make your point
Mon Sep 23 17:16:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you might as well quote it in Navajo
Mon Sep 23 17:16:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I fail to see why you are just attacking me for fun
Mon Sep 23 17:16:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Descartes wrote in Latin
Mon Sep 23 17:17:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the french is a translation
Mon Sep 23 17:17:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:je parle francais petit con
Mon Sep 23 17:20:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just can't stand twits who feel they need to attack me out of the blue... ESPECIALLY using misguided facts from my own background
Mon Sep 23 17:21:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you do admit to attacking me for no reason?
Mon Sep 23 17:22:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Mon Sep 23 17:22:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is exactly what it sounded like
Mon Sep 23 17:22:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not making shit up
Mon Sep 23 17:23:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not have the proof that Discours is in Latin in front of me, but I do know Descartes wrote in latin
Mon Sep 23 17:23:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is not what this moronic conversation is abbout
Mon Sep 23 17:24:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not as a matter of general practice, no, he did not
Mon Sep 23 17:24:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:talking about Descartes, in contrast to your point, is something I studied in detail
Mon Sep 23 17:24:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does that mean I know everything? no
Mon Sep 23 17:25:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it does mean I am not making shit up like you are saying
Mon Sep 23 17:25:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Mon Sep 23 17:27:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what are you talking about now?
Mon Sep 23 18:06:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any I3 folks on right now?
Mon Sep 23 18:55:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what sort of thing would you use an object number for?
Mon Sep 23 18:55:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in any system, it is generally bad to embed meaning inan id
Mon Sep 23 18:59:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is not a multi-threaded driver
Mon Sep 23 18:59:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:two people cannot search at the same time
Mon Sep 23 19:02:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sounds like you are making this much more complicated than it needs to be
Mon Sep 23 19:03:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sounds like a lot of gobbledygook doing nothing
Mon Sep 23 23:45:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:racist jokes will get your mud thrown off intermud, so please avoid them]
Mon Sep 23 23:53:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, thank you for pointing out something I did not know about descartes :)

Tue Sep 24 00:09:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:or you just like taking cheap shots?
Tue Sep 24 00:10:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I would like to see you back up your pot shots
Tue Sep 24 00:10:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I fucking hate people who just slam things like that
Tue Sep 24 00:10:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:maybe
Tue Sep 24 00:10:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:maybe I am tired of yahoos who have ndone nothing slam something without backing it up
Tue Sep 24 00:11:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I did not say you have to, I said you have to back up your slams
Tue Sep 24 00:11:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:and you could even be polite about it, god forbid
Tue Sep 24 00:11:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:well, aren't you sweet
Tue Sep 24 00:12:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:but you have not even justified your claim yet
Tue Sep 24 00:12:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:compassion and politeness would not have gotten NM given for free to the public, now, would it?
Tue Sep 24 00:14:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes
Tue Sep 24 00:14:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I have had several offers
Tue Sep 24 00:14:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I note you have yet to even offer an honest criticism of it
Tue Sep 24 00:14:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:just attcks on it
Tue Sep 24 00:14:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:and me
Tue Sep 24 00:16:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:let me answr with a question
Tue Sep 24 00:17:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:what place does intermud have on a fantasy mud?
Tue Sep 24 00:18:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:intercre keeps cres from coding :)
Tue Sep 24 00:18:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the intermud chat lines become what people do when they mud, and nothing ghets done
Tue Sep 24 00:19:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I think that is fair Tim... I think though that is most useful before a mud is open when it is a core group of people developing the mud
Tue Sep 24 00:19:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:once the mud is open though, and there is less cohesiveness in the development group, *I* think that falls apart
Tue Sep 24 00:20:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:since NM has not beeen in developpment for 4 years, I have seen no need for NM to be on intermud
Tue Sep 24 00:21:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I wonder what happened to Rhaje... he never offered anything other than slams and pot shots...
Tue Sep 24 00:21:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:IVr2.5
Tue Sep 24 00:21:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:why?
Tue Sep 24 00:22:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yep, it was hell to convert
Tue Sep 24 00:23:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yep
Tue Sep 24 00:24:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the whole reasion I did nM IV was for the NM mud
Tue Sep 24 00:24:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I don't release the mudlib for the sake of writing a mudlib
Tue Sep 24 00:24:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I do all of that for the mud, and release the lib just for the benefit of others
Tue Sep 24 00:25:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:basically, NM 3 has a lot of serious flaws and limitations
Tue Sep 24 00:25:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:so NM IV was designed to address those and make NM mud be able to live beyond what it oculd under NM 3
Tue Sep 24 00:25:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:thanks Duuk :)
Tue Sep 24 00:26:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I coded Praxis and an area which is no longer there]
Tue Sep 24 00:26:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the biggest area I have done is on IgorMud
Tue Sep 24 00:26:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is there somewhere still
Tue Sep 24 00:28:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I would love to code an area
Tue Sep 24 00:28:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:but I have no time]
Tue Sep 24 00:29:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I am writing a Java book, writing a Java mud, doing NM IV, doing the Mudos windows thing, working full time, lookingg to find a higher paying job, all at the same time
Tue Sep 24 00:29:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:oh yeah, I also am part owner of ca company and I am maintaining that product too
Tue Sep 24 00:30:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no, I have a girlfriend
Tue Sep 24 00:30:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:at any rate, I do not see me writing an area any time soon
Tue Sep 24 00:30:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:NM does not release its spells
Tue Sep 24 01:06:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there was never a tell-reply in I3
Tue Sep 24 01:07:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the parser rules work in the following release
Tue Sep 24 01:07:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:blockign and such is noted through an error packet
Tue Sep 24 01:07:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:which I think is truly bizarre
Tue Sep 24 01:11:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes, I am just in different windows a bunch
Tue Sep 24 10:20:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:check the players race inside the command and don't alow it if it is the wrong race
Tue Sep 24 12:56:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:grumble
Tue Sep 24 12:57:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:by adding a help file for it in thr e races help dir
Tue Sep 24 14:13:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:idle times is here
Tue Sep 24 14:42:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO colour is an all else being equal thing
Tue Sep 24 14:42:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and all else is rarely equal when looking at PC's :)
Tue Sep 24 14:46:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all my machines have been gateways
Tue Sep 24 14:46:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, but I have no idea what it would be like to have your TV as a monitor
Tue Sep 24 14:47:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes... make sure you do not get the telepath modem :)
Tue Sep 24 14:47:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:pay the extra $50 for the other kind
Tue Sep 24 14:47:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:telepath == piece of shit
Tue Sep 24 14:48:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:micro something or other
Tue Sep 24 14:48:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a gateway laptop, and two desktops
Tue Sep 24 14:48:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the laptop rocks big tme :)
Tue Sep 24 14:49:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, well, at least it does plug dikes and pick tulips
Tue Sep 24 14:53:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if this is tech support, god help you
Tue Sep 24 14:59:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:speaking of PnP, who is the FUCKING MORON at MS that decided NT 4.0 should not have it?
Tue Sep 24 15:09:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Linux bites
Tue Sep 24 15:11:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a smelly cat!
Tue Sep 24 15:19:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:series 2?
Tue Sep 24 15:57:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why the fuck would a modem default to 56k?
Tue Sep 24 15:58:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know how to send a special command string automatically with NT RAS?
Tue Sep 24 15:59:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone?
Tue Sep 24 16:08:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is a place called the netherlands?
Tue Sep 24 16:09:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I thought it was near the corn palace in SD
Tue Sep 24 16:10:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I thought we established long ago the dutch were the emperors of kiddie porn
Tue Sep 24 16:12:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not Dutch
Tue Sep 24 16:12:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sure Leto does not want to admit that, and we should respect his privacy
Tue Sep 24 16:13:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:go to your nearest Dutch consolate, and say "I want to plug dikes"
Tue Sep 24 19:28:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:restore_object() and save_object() in Java?
Tue Sep 24 19:28:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what exactly are you trying to do?
Tue Sep 24 19:42:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:*scream*
Tue Sep 24 19:43:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:At least in 2 places
Tue Sep 24 19:47:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:NM IV to my knowledge will never have weather as part of the mudlib
Tue Sep 24 19:48:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it depends on how extensive you want to do it... IMHO it does not add much to the game
Tue Sep 24 19:49:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I do not understand the question
Tue Sep 24 19:49:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Zackron... that is a massive and difficult undertaking :)
Tue Sep 24 19:49:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Minnesota
Tue Sep 24 19:50:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I don't even know what I am doing with this yet :)
Tue Sep 24 19:51:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I could go commercial, or start a little mud, or give it out to the public...
Tue Sep 24 19:51:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:cool
Tue Sep 24 19:52:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:twin cities
Tue Sep 24 19:53:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:except everyone from MN is from finland or sweden or something like that
Tue Sep 24 19:55:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes, if you know how to do it :)
Tue Sep 24 21:02:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:would anyone out there perchance have used Symantec dbAnywhere?
Tue Sep 24 21:02:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Tue Sep 24 23:55:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Sep 25 00:06:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:boggle me
Wed Sep 25 00:06:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:man, some of the Java JDBC drivers out there suck hard

Wed Sep 25 12:45:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Wed Sep 25 15:35:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the convert_string() efun is a little messed up
Wed Sep 25 15:35:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sefun
Wed Sep 25 17:28:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:huh?
Wed Sep 25 17:28:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you don't manually use call to move players around as a matteroo of course
Wed Sep 25 17:45:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/daemon/give.c should nto be there
Wed Sep 25 21:03:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doing the sizeof(0 thing makes no difference
Wed Sep 25 21:03:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the best thing is foreach(element in array) { }
Wed Sep 25 21:05:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea, maybe DGD
Wed Sep 25 21:06:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:an LPMud driver
Wed Sep 25 21:07:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not sure where the latest is kept
Wed Sep 25 21:08:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:check the lPMud faq
Wed Sep 25 22:04:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM/Mudos is already compiled for windows 95/NT
Wed Sep 25 23:47:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean by look?
Wed Sep 25 23:49:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmmm
Wed Sep 25 23:50:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it certainly requires the TCP/IP stack to be running
Wed Sep 25 23:51:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know
Wed Sep 25 23:53:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is written in C++
Wed Sep 25 23:53:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I doubt I will have it do anything but TCP/IP
Thu Sep 26 00:15:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a sparc 20 is about a low end pentium
Thu Sep 26 00:15:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that is not a fair comparison cause they do different things
Thu Sep 26 00:15:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and most of the things a sparc 20 is used for it kicks a pentium ass
Thu Sep 26 00:18:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:solaris is the most stable OS I have ever used by far

Thu Sep 26 00:23:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:holy shit it works
Thu Sep 26 00:24:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it appears to work :)
Thu Sep 26 00:24:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:ok, that broke.
Thu Sep 26 00:27:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:this mud  will NOT use telnet damnit!
Thu Sep 26 00:29:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no problem really
Thu Sep 26 00:29:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:this will use a three tier distributed model... only the bare necessary stuff will be on the client
Thu Sep 26 00:46:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Thu Sep 26 00:47:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test 2

Thu Sep 26 00:58:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it prevents the file from being doubly included

Thu Sep 26 01:05:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a horrid thing to do
Thu Sep 26 01:05:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#define gunk makes for massively unreadable code
Thu Sep 26 01:06:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is useful for defining constants
Thu Sep 26 01:06:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is horrible when used as code shorthand
Thu Sep 26 01:08:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grabbing this player in a variable saves no processing
Thu Sep 26 01:09:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this_player() is an efun
Thu Sep 26 01:09:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but still what?
Thu Sep 26 01:10:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is memory access
Thu Sep 26 01:11:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:GetName() is the proper thing to use... GetCapName() is aklmost never the right thing to use
Thu Sep 26 01:14:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Thu Sep 26 01:18:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ugh, database access is what is killing this damn thing

Thu Sep 26 01:20:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops
Thu Sep 26 10:57:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you were not able to trash all tcp sockets on the machien by updatingone file
Thu Sep 26 10:57:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coincidence
Thu Sep 26 10:58:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:completely unrelated
Thu Sep 26 10:58:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what OS?
Thu Sep 26 10:58:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not doing it... your process cannnot affect other sockets
Thu Sep 26 10:59:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it is, it is a bug involving sunos... but I ran three muds on sunos a few months agos
Thu Sep 26 10:59:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is pure coincidence or bad system administration or a bad OS
Thu Sep 26 11:02:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:currect?
Thu Sep 26 11:02:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it makes no sense
Thu Sep 26 11:03:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean current object?
Thu Sep 26 11:03:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if something this destructive is happening, it is bbecause your sys admin is messed up
Thu Sep 26 11:03:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:furthermore, you might want to upgrade to a more stable OS like solaris
Thu Sep 26 11:06:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is
Thu Sep 26 11:06:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your system is fucked up
Thu Sep 26 11:06:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because your sys admin did something goofy
Thu Sep 26 11:06:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they can't
Thu Sep 26 11:06:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless there is a serious systematic flaw
Thu Sep 26 11:07:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:even still, if there were a bug that serious in the driver, don't you think someone else might have noticed it?
Thu Sep 26 11:08:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on SunOS? not bloody likely
Thu Sep 26 11:08:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you were using Ultric or HPUX or something maybe
Thu Sep 26 11:09:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, but not one that others do not notice
Thu Sep 26 11:09:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:major ones
Thu Sep 26 11:10:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SunOS and Solaris are perhaps two of the most common mud environments
Thu Sep 26 11:10:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle: they don't get discovered years into the problem
Thu Sep 26 11:10:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean, major ones on highly tested repetitive situations
Thu Sep 26 11:11:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are not talking about finding a little bug
Thu Sep 26 11:11:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are talking about a problem that makes mudos unuseable on SunOS
Thu Sep 26 11:12:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Talamar: if an application can ever crash a UNIX, it is the OS fault, not the application
Thu Sep 26 11:13:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is why most operating systems limit the nuber of resources a given user or process can use
Thu Sep 26 11:14:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what did you limit descriptors to?
Thu Sep 26 11:14:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a small mud should be limited to 64, a medium one to 128
Thu Sep 26 11:14:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the system
Thu Sep 26 11:14:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:medium ~= 80 players
Thu Sep 26 11:14:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the source does nto touch descriptors
Thu Sep 26 11:15:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is an OS default unless you change it for a given shell
Thu Sep 26 11:15:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on SunOS the limitdefaults to 64
Thu Sep 26 11:16:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some ISP's should understand how to operate their machines before going into business
Thu Sep 26 11:17:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whoever cares
Thu Sep 26 11:21:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, ccombined likely with an OS bug and topped probably with an obscure MudOS one
Thu Sep 26 11:22:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what file were you updating?
Thu Sep 26 11:23:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can't see how that would trigger an obscure mudos bug
Thu Sep 26 11:23:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because chewey is making shit up
Thu Sep 26 11:29:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Turrican, when is this solaris unuseable?
Thu Sep 26 11:30:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle that confirms what Zakk said
Thu Sep 26 11:30:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:something at that point is pointing to an odd memory location
Thu Sep 26 11:32:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means what I said earlier
Thu Sep 26 11:32:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:something is seriously worng with the way the OS is setup, and you have an obscure memory bug in mudos
Thu Sep 26 11:32:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos should crash at that point
Thu Sep 26 11:35:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that probably would be useful, but not wise :)
Thu Sep 26 11:38:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to look at it in gdb
Thu Sep 26 11:38:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and get a human reradable trace
Thu Sep 26 11:38:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:information on doing that comes with mudos
Thu Sep 26 11:40:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a walk in the park
Thu Sep 26 17:37:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Saint, fuck off
Thu Sep 26 17:37:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you ask another woman what she is wearing and relative absurdity is off this channel
Thu Sep 26 17:38:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Sep 26 17:39:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you think that is all this about, then you are simply too stupid to be on this channel
Thu Sep 26 17:39:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is pretty damn stupid
Thu Sep 26 17:41:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how about you just shut the hell up Saint?
Thu Sep 26 18:24:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:what do you mean?
Thu Sep 26 18:25:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:code the object
Thu Sep 26 18:26:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:there is nothinbg more to it
Thu Sep 26 18:26:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:though I appreciate the smart ass comment
Thu Sep 26 18:26:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes it does
Thu Sep 26 18:27:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you got it
Thu Sep 26 18:27:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:yes
Thu Sep 26 18:29:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:SetPreventDrop() :)
Thu Sep 26 18:29:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:life is much simpler on NM than tmi-2 :)
Thu Sep 26 18:30:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:SetPreventDrop() does that
Thu Sep 26 18:31:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:so mykrul please explain to me in what way I was not informative?
Thu Sep 26 18:33:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:JavaMud is runnong  on delos.imaginary.com
Thu Sep 26 18:33:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is pure Java
Thu Sep 26 18:33:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:there is no compiled native code
Thu Sep 26 18:33:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is just in time compiled
Thu Sep 26 18:34:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is plenty fast except where my coding is stupid
Thu Sep 26 19:04:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know what an IllegalMonitorStateException is?
Thu Sep 26 22:29:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:grumble... that Singapore mud is causing me hadaches! :)
Thu Sep 26 23:05:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:or just play JavaMud!
Thu Sep 26 23:06:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:anyone can login, not much to do
Thu Sep 26 23:09:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:bing
Thu Sep 26 23:09:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:well, it has to start somewhere
Thu Sep 26 23:09:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the docus right now is not on the mudlib
Thu Sep 26 23:09:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it is on the server portion
Thu Sep 26 23:58:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:are there people out there interested in the JavaMud project that want information about it? ( I know Satan and Tim are, but they are not online)
Thu Sep 26 23:59:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:ahh :) http://www.imaginary.com/Java/Mud is where I am putting all info... it includes the currently available docs
Fri Sep 27 00:01:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:there are certainly somemissing links... but that might help give a starting idea of what is being done
Sun Sep 29 20:27:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I guess not, it is not on tonight
Sun Sep 29 21:39:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is automatic
Sun Sep 29 21:40:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you go to training areas and spend them
Sun Sep 29 21:42:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Blitz coded that stuff and I actually know nothing about it
Sun Sep 29 22:06:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am actually working hard on it... it would be ready right this seocnd but I am having to add races by hand
Sun Sep 29 22:07:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:very tedious
Sun Sep 29 22:18:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:sorta, but I can always answer questions while I work
Sun Sep 29 22:20:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM 3 sucks compared to both NM IV and Lima
Sun Sep 29 22:20:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what is the error?
Sun Sep 29 22:23:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what is the error?
Sun Sep 29 22:24:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what is the error text... in your errors logs
Sun Sep 29 23:23:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:found a v22b13 crasher :)
Sun Sep 29 23:27:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the people at dreamverse a bunch of chicken shits?
Sun Sep 29 23:27:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I do not even know what one is
Sun Sep 29 23:28:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:they are definitely full of it Ex
Sun Sep 29 23:29:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:where did that person last login from?
Sun Sep 29 23:30:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:that was me
Sun Sep 29 23:30:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:hi Miranda :)
Sun Sep 29 23:31:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Mon Sep 30 00:06:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I got a challenge for people using NM who want to see the next release soon :)
Mon Sep 30 00:08:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:at any rate... the only thing preventing a release....
Mon Sep 30 00:08:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:about 100 race configuration files
Mon Sep 30 00:09:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:because I moved from hard coded racees to configuration files
Mon Sep 30 00:10:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I could release the lib with two and let you all come up with more and make them available to each other
Mon Sep 30 00:10:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:in the mean time, I will write a web tool to make it easier to do this stuff
Mon Sep 30 00:11:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I have ogre and human right now :)
Mon Sep 30 00:11:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:two races is anemic
Mon Sep 30 00:12:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the first one is hard... but once you understand, just tedious as hell
Mon Sep 30 00:13:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, it does not good if no one is going to share their races
Mon Sep 30 00:14:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, I am going to be writing web-based mud admin tools
Mon Sep 30 00:14:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:you would be able to ftp race files
Mon Sep 30 00:15:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:as well explained as I can make it... the rest is basically intuitive
Mon Sep 30 00:16:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the advantage of this system, of course, is that you no longer are tied in any way to the races or classes that ship with NM
Mon Sep 30 00:16:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:ftp.imaginary.com
Mon Sep 30 00:16:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:not that... it was just that races and classes in the current NM release are hard coded
Mon Sep 30 00:17:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:which makes for igly code
Mon Sep 30 00:17:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what I call a big fucking switch
Mon Sep 30 01:07:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I think we can call IVr2.6 done... the last alpha... thank god
Mon Sep 30 01:08:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:2 races
Mon Sep 30 01:17:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:it has bveen ages since I put together a release
Mon Sep 30 01:26:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when I have packaged it
Mon Sep 30 01:26:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Linux: the OS for loser geeks
Mon Sep 30 01:27:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I run an operating system that tends to work without recompiling the whole freakin operating system every other day
Mon Sep 30 01:28:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:honestly, I think Linux is much too hard for its usefulness
Mon Sep 30 01:28:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it lacks the stability that something commercial does have
Mon Sep 30 01:29:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I didn't... but it still couldn't act as a solid network server
Mon Sep 30 01:30:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hundreds of dollars?
Mon Sep 30 01:30:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NT cost me $99
Mon Sep 30 01:30:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:much more stable, and much easier to administer a network with
Mon Sep 30 01:30:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I despise Microsoft
Mon Sep 30 01:30:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I am not so braindead that I cannot admit where their strengths are
Mon Sep 30 01:33:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:solaris 2.5 rocks
Mon Sep 30 01:35:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can run a mud on NT
Mon Sep 30 01:35:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Sep 30 01:36:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the 95 interface
Mon Sep 30 01:37:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically
Mon Sep 30 01:37:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:except for PnP
Mon Sep 30 01:38:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you want linux?
Mon Sep 30 01:39:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, shit I have a sparcstation, and NT box, and a win95 laptop, so I guess I don;t have to chose
Mon Sep 30 01:40:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:quake with linux sucks
Mon Sep 30 01:44:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:learn Java and get an MBA and you will be cool
Mon Sep 30 01:45:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:I kinda know Java too
Mon Sep 30 01:46:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:whhat useful thing would C++ teach?
Mon Sep 30 01:47:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:you don't much know Java do you :)
Mon Sep 30 01:48:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:Java has little in common with C++... it has some syntaxtic commonalities with C
Mon Sep 30 01:49:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:it is probably most similar to LPC... LPC with typing
Mon Sep 30 01:50:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:Java is unrelated to C++
Mon Sep 30 01:50:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:its roots are in some other OO languages
Mon Sep 30 01:50:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:I did not know that was a C++ invention
Mon Sep 30 01:51:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:DUH
Mon Sep 30 01:51:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:C++ was not the origina of OOP :)
Mon Sep 30 01:52:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:you are talking as if Java is an offshoot of C++ because it has inheritance
Mon Sep 30 01:53:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:I have no idea what that means
Mon Sep 30 01:53:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:thanks rust :)
Mon Sep 30 01:56:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:wow, IVr2.5 was released in may
Mon Sep 30 01:57:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:the NM mudlib
Mon Sep 30 01:57:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:I am putting together a new release
Mon Sep 30 01:57:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:huh?
Mon Sep 30 02:05:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:type mudlist
Mon Sep 30 02:05:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:though that is not a good guage, since more TMI muds are in use than Lima
Mon Sep 30 02:05:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:a fact that completely boggles my mind
Mon Sep 30 02:06:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I like NM best :)
Mon Sep 30 02:06:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:but I think that if you were to rank relative merits of libs, TMI-2 would be way down in the basement
Mon Sep 30 02:07:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:that is not the same lib
Mon Sep 30 02:07:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM is a different mudlib... the code base was rewritten a year ago or so
Mon Sep 30 02:08:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:basically the best tow are Lima and NM... Lima is more admin oriented, NM more player oriented
Mon Sep 30 02:09:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I also think soundly designed
Mon Sep 30 02:09:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and I think soundly designed does make an impact on best
Mon Sep 30 02:10:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:there is no design behind tmi-2... it was a lot of hacks by a lot of people with varying degrees of talent
Mon Sep 30 02:10:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM is still under development and not quite done yet :)
Mon Sep 30 02:11:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:hence the alpha status of it :)
Mon Sep 30 02:11:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:not true
Mon Sep 30 02:11:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, my days adding to NM are numbered
Mon Sep 30 02:12:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM V... I don;t know
Mon Sep 30 02:12:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:currently, I wouod say yes
Mon Sep 30 02:12:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:unless there is something more to do
Mon Sep 30 02:13:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:basically JavaMud is tinkering... if it turns into something, cool, if I get bored with it, cool
Mon Sep 30 02:13:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:once NM V is out though, I don't see what is left to do except UI work
Mon Sep 30 02:13:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and that is not really mudlib work
Mon Sep 30 02:13:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:user interface
Mon Sep 30 02:14:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:why?
Mon Sep 30 02:15:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM is perfectly cool
Mon Sep 30 02:15:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:not talking about that Zac :)
Mon Sep 30 02:15:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am talking about making LP's more accessible
Mon Sep 30 02:15:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:any mudlib is going to have releases after you start with it
Mon Sep 30 02:16:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:only whole libs
Mon Sep 30 02:16:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am not a fan of people upgrading mudlibs
Mon Sep 30 02:16:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I think once you chose a mudlib, you should stick with it
Mon Sep 30 02:16:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Mon Sep 30 02:16:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am testing the install of NM IVr2.6 right now
Mon Sep 30 02:17:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:JavaMud is going to be GUI :)
Mon Sep 30 02:18:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:JavaMud might even make your toast, but that might be in r2
Mon Sep 30 02:19:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes, IVr2.6 is the final alpha
Mon Sep 30 02:20:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:depends if it installs right
Mon Sep 30 02:20:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:30 minutes or tomorrow
Mon Sep 30 02:21:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:this is, however, the feature freeze for the lib
Mon Sep 30 02:21:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:just bug fixes until NM V
Mon Sep 30 02:22:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:fortunately, H7 is not Mudos :)
Mon Sep 30 02:22:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no way
Mon Sep 30 02:22:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:that is a sure sign it sucks
Mon Sep 30 02:23:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:"Hey! Use my mudlib which uses none of the features of your driver!"
Mon Sep 30 02:25:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:heh.. Mudos has "Cheking for flakey Linux systems" in the build.MudOS :)
Mon Sep 30 02:25:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:does anyone remember if the NM install starts the mud after compile? or do you have to start it yourself?
Mon Sep 30 02:26:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:cool
Mon Sep 30 02:26:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I would hate to go to bed while it was compiling and wake up to find someone else had logged in first and made thesmelves admin of my mud
Mon Sep 30 02:26:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I think I am going to go to bed while it compiles
Mon Sep 30 02:27:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and complete the package in the mornin
Mon Sep 30 02:30:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:ok, well good night :)
Mon Sep 30 02:30:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the lib will be released tomorrow for sure :)
Mon Sep 30 12:40:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it looks like it works fine... ran into a problem with my OS
Mon Sep 30 12:41:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:boo
Mon Sep 30 12:42:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a problem anyone else would have encountered
Mon Sep 30 12:47:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare IVr2.6 Test:are we all here?
Mon Sep 30 12:48:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:need to make one spelling change then it will be released
Mon Sep 30 12:52:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:PowerBlower
Mon Sep 30 12:53:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Saint' aren't you supposed to stay off this line for the sake of your entire mud?
Mon Sep 30 12:54:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck
Mon Sep 30 12:54:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:scratch that...
Mon Sep 30 12:55:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I just did tar -cf Nightmare.tar instead of tar -xf Nightmare.tar
Mon Sep 30 12:55:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:GOD DAMNIT
Mon Sep 30 12:56:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, it is going to take me another 3 hours to put this release together, and I have to go to a job interview, so we will not see this until tonight
Mon Sep 30 12:57:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just basically deleted the release tar file
Mon Sep 30 12:58:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not have three hours to blow
Mon Sep 30 12:59:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:releasing the lib is more than tar -cf
Mon Sep 30 12:59:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have to remove SCCS files, remove ~ files, set up the auto-admin into the lib, fix the help files, edit the release information
Mon Sep 30 16:13:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, yes, IE has RCP going
Mon Sep 30 16:15:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the interview went well
Mon Sep 30 16:15:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yes, NM does have RCP
Mon Sep 30 16:15:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do a mudlist on a mud and it will tell you if it does RCP
Mon Sep 30 16:20:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have never heard of that befoe
Mon Sep 30 16:43:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what's that?
Mon Sep 30 16:45:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really... I wrote that program two years ago
Mon Sep 30 16:45:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am working on something new that works from inside a web page
Mon Sep 30 16:46:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are where REALMS_DIRS points to
Mon Sep 30 17:01:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update /secure/daemon/master.c
Mon Sep 30 17:28:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, anyone heard about the chinese version of MS windows95?
Mon Sep 30 17:37:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tarring up IVr2.6 now... will be about 5 minutes
Mon Sep 30 17:41:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thank god no
Mon Sep 30 17:43:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Sep 30 17:43:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is available now
Mon Sep 30 17:43:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the release has no new docs
Mon Sep 30 17:46:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, all new documentation will be web based
Mon Sep 30 17:57:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people have more than 32k exp on most muds :)
Mon Sep 30 17:57:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:int is 32 bits
Mon Sep 30 17:58:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no problem :)
Mon Sep 30 18:12:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you'll live
Mon Sep 30 18:12:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Mon Sep 30 18:56:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:aristotle: it is a drive rbug
Mon Sep 30 18:58:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ANY TIME the mud crashes, it is because of a bug in the driver
Mon Sep 30 18:58:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no mudlib code should ever crash the driver
Mon Sep 30 18:59:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in a world where the driver has no bugs
Mon Sep 30 18:59:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Vashkar, I am sure he has a zillion traces on that
Mon Sep 30 18:59:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Lathander, you do have the buggy code on Lima
Mon Sep 30 18:59:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just must ot have the parse rule being used on NM
Mon Sep 30 19:00:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those are errors in v22b13, ignore htem
Mon Sep 30 19:02:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:inclue other's stuff?
Mon Sep 30 19:03:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that problem was fixed
Mon Sep 30 19:11:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that one looks like a mudlib bug where I did not implement the driver parser fix
Mon Sep 30 19:11:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am testing the fix right now
Mon Sep 30 19:14:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:quick fix:
Mon Sep 30 19:14:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in /lib/item.c
Mon Sep 30 19:14:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the method direct_look_at_obj()
Mon Sep 30 19:14:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the first line of the method should be:
Mon Sep 30 19:15:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if( environment() != this_player() && environment() != environment(this_player()) )
Mon Sep 30 19:15:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:return "#Someone else has that!";
Mon Sep 30 19:15:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just insert those two lines
Mon Sep 30 19:26:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can do whatever you want
Mon Sep 30 19:27:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:find top_dir - print | xargs rgep blah
Mon Sep 30 19:27:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:without the space between - and print
Mon Sep 30 20:12:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I announced it ages ago
Mon Sep 30 20:13:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:status of what?
Mon Sep 30 20:13:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I annouced a fix, there is nothing more to report
Mon Sep 30 20:15:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudos parser design has stabilized
Mon Sep 30 20:15:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the mudlib reflects that design
Mon Sep 30 20:15:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people can now sit, stand, and lay down
Mon Sep 30 20:16:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:colour wrapping works
Mon Sep 30 20:17:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it also has a new race and class system
Mon Sep 30 20:17:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:races and classes are created through config files
Mon Sep 30 20:17:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rather than hard coded into the mudlib
Mon Sep 30 21:14:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no specs, you sorta have to look at /secure/daemon/remote.c :)
Mon Sep 30 22:12:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what?
Mon Sep 30 22:13:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Mon Sep 30 22:14:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/daemon/remote.c
Mon Sep 30 22:15:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I plan to change the system to use mud mode
Mon Sep 30 22:15:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless kalinash finishes first :)
Mon Sep 30 22:16:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:someone is obviously extremely engrossed with the product
Mon Sep 30 22:17:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and we all know how addictive mushes are
Mon Sep 30 22:23:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is x width or height?
Mon Sep 30 22:24:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks!
Mon Sep 30 23:04:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what DB said
Mon Sep 30 23:05:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:deathblade, Java mud is up... I can send locates whenever
Mon Sep 30 23:05:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea, I am hoping you can tell me what the logs say :)
Mon Sep 30 23:06:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:wizzes need to be able to wear things
Mon Sep 30 23:06:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I just sent out a locate deathblade
Mon Sep 30 23:06:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Slilvyar cres can't wear armour ,.. they do not have bodies
Mon Sep 30 23:08:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes, and error will occur
Mon Sep 30 23:08:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it would be a silly time wasting check
Mon Sep 30 23:11:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Mon Sep 30 23:11:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, my locates are getting to the ruter... they are just not going any further
Mon Sep 30 23:21:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:sent
Mon Sep 30 23:28:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:who does not have reconnect?
Mon Sep 30 23:28:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:what are they using for I3 impl?
Mon Sep 30 23:29:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:say no more :)
Mon Sep 30 23:29:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:JavaMud has reconnect and it is not even LPC!
Mon Sep 30 23:35:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:ready?
Mon Sep 30 23:39:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:sent
Mon Sep 30 23:41:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:let me try one more time...
Mon Sep 30 23:41:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:sent
Mon Sep 30 23:41:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Bumbkin just use the climb inheritable
Mon Sep 30 23:42:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:that is what it is for
Mon Sep 30 23:42:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:nothing in the rror logs?
Mon Sep 30 23:42:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I am definitely sending... it is leaving this machine
Mon Sep 30 23:42:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:the climb stuff is part of the room code
Mon Sep 30 23:42:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you inherit the climb module
Mon Sep 30 23:43:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:and you customize it
Mon Sep 30 23:43:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:LIMB_CLIMB
Mon Sep 30 23:43:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:LIB_CLIMB
Mon Sep 30 23:44:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@JavaMud:nothing significant has happened with it since 1993
Mon Sep 30 23:44:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Deathblade?
Mon Sep 30 23:45:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:NM does not lag your machine
Mon Sep 30 23:45:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:certainly not with no one on
Mon Sep 30 23:45:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:Deathblade: are the lre like errors logs?
Mon Sep 30 23:46:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:also the default NM compile is with debugging on, so you can send any bug reports to Beek
Mon Sep 30 23:46:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:at some point you want to turn that off and compile without debug mode
Mon Sep 30 23:46:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:byut at any rate, any mudos is going to be the same with a single user
Mon Sep 30 23:47:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:out of curiousity, define lagging?
Mon Sep 30 23:47:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:if you say combat was slow, I will kill you in a slow and painful way
Mon Sep 30 23:48:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:you mean a 0?
Mon Sep 30 23:48:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:no, combat is not slow YOU  are slow
Mon Sep 30 23:50:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I do not see how I could be sending 0
Mon Sep 30 23:50:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:unfortunately, thngs are not documented as well as I woudl like
Mon Sep 30 23:52:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the thing is... I just send packet.toString()
Mon Sep 30 23:52:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so it should be I am sending nothing or everything
Mon Sep 30 23:54:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I KNOW for a fact I will send this string when I step next: 59 + "({"locate-req",5,"JavaMud", "descartes",0,0,"deathblade",})"
Mon Sep 30 23:56:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:test
Mon Sep 30 23:57:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I actually send everything in two pieces... socket.writeInt(size); socket.writeBytes(str);
Mon Sep 30 23:57:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which works fine for every other packet I send, and should work no matter what
Mon Sep 30 23:58:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the thing is... this is not code specific to locates
Mon Sep 30 23:58:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a centralized place that ends all packets
Mon Sep 30 23:58:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only thing I could have wrong such that only locates would not go is a bad format to locate.toString()
Mon Sep 30 23:59:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then something is goofy in mudos mud mode
Mon Sep 30 23:59:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I KNOW I sent what I just described
Tue Oct  1 00:00:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am... that is why i know what I am sending
Tue Oct  1 00:00:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have even stepped through the code to the instant it does the send
Tue Oct  1 00:00:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sending the int 59 + the string "({"locate-req",5,"JavaMud", "descartes",0,0,"deathblade",})"
Tue Oct  1 00:04:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:win95? mkdir /secure/cmds/common and /cmds/common
Tue Oct  1 00:05:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my only reasonable guess is that somehow on a short packet mudos is having a problem with something written in two separate operations like my packet is
Tue Oct  1 00:05:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I cannot possibly be sending 0
Tue Oct  1 00:07:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well... that would be a router issue :) (are you saying I am connectign to often?)
Tue Oct  1 00:08:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:test
Tue Oct  1 00:09:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:cannot send a channel-m that short
Tue Oct  1 00:09:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:DB I know I am not sending 0, whatever I am doing
Tue Oct  1 00:09:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:72
Tue Oct  1 00:11:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:sent
Tue Oct  1 00:12:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I agree
Tue Oct  1 00:12:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:it would have to be something weird about locate-req either on your end or mine
Tue Oct  1 00:13:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I have stepped through the Java though to the point it sends the actual packets, both good and bad
Tue Oct  1 00:13:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:good == channel-m, bad -== locate-req
Tue Oct  1 00:15:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:does MudOS generate an error on bad packet receives?
Tue Oct  1 00:17:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:I have looked at that packet string a bajillion times though anyways, even repeated over here... I cannot for the life of me see anything bad about it
Tue Oct  1 00:18:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:there is no define for them
Tue Oct  1 00:18:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is in /daemon/terminal.c
Tue Oct  1 00:43:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what were oyu doing??? what was slow?
Tue Oct  1 00:44:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is EXTREMELY unlikely that there is much of a difference among mudlibs with three people online doing nothing
Tue Oct  1 00:44:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:was it that fighting was slow?
Tue Oct  1 00:45:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, loading the mud takes a long time
Tue Oct  1 00:45:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the initial start up of the mud is very slow because Nightmare preloads a lot of shit
Tue Oct  1 00:45:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but the actual speed of the mud is not an issue
Tue Oct  1 00:47:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the overhead of 3 people on a mud is non-existent
Tue Oct  1 00:48:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it errors because there are no rooms with it
Tue Oct  1 00:48:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are going off into la-la land where no room is
Tue Oct  1 00:49:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mortal chars cannot wear armour?
Tue Oct  1 00:49:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what was the error?
Tue Oct  1 00:56:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:thanks... lemme know when
Tue Oct  1 00:59:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are libel to  be lots of little bugs that are eeasy to fix like the armour one in IUVr2.6
Tue Oct  1 01:00:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has not been tested on NM proper like most releases
Tue Oct  1 01:00:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it comes after some heavy changes to the parser
Tue Oct  1 01:00:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you would not notice it nippie :)
Tue Oct  1 01:01:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is only actual a bug noticelbe in a demo helm in the Ylsrim domain of the release
Tue Oct  1 01:01:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:easy fix: one I can tell you what to do
Tue Oct  1 01:01:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hard fix: one that has no solution or cannot easily be described
Tue Oct  1 01:04:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:give works fine for me
Tue Oct  1 01:04:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:22 beta
Tue Oct  1 01:05:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the alphas had many different structural change sin the parser which are incompatible with one another
Tue Oct  1 01:05:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when upgrading a driver, read the change logs
Tue Oct  1 01:13:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@JavaMud:sent
Tue Oct  1 01:24:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how could it log as 0?
Tue Oct  1 01:24:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I cannot actually send a 0?
Tue Oct  1 01:28:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a bit of LPC exception handling would rock about now
Tue Oct  1 01:45:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for a look at the new Nightmare Administrator administration interface at NM, take a look at http://www.imaginary.com/~borg/dev/NightmareAministrator.html with a Java browser
Tue Oct  1 01:45:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only functional piece to it is Exit and MudOS help
Tue Oct  1 01:45:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I would like feedback on the look and feel to it...
Tue Oct  1 01:45:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java GUI sucks right now :)
Tue Oct  1 01:49:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Tue Oct  1 01:49:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you will be able to copy existing ones, add new ones, delete old ones
Tue Oct  1 01:51:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, it is not really a list... it is an administrative menu
Tue Oct  1 01:51:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:click Admin|Race
Tue Oct  1 01:52:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that menu item works
Tue Oct  1 01:54:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:each limb may have any number of armours which can be worn on it
Tue Oct  1 01:55:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:youy will have a limb selected on the lieft, and the rest of the stuff on the right will be filled in
Tue Oct  1 01:55:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, a weapon is just another kind of armour
Tue Oct  1 01:56:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:armours are associated with limbs
Tue Oct  1 01:56:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all limbs are associated with armour types
Tue Oct  1 02:02:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need the browser open
Tue Oct  1 02:02:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it uses the browser to display the help
Tue Oct  1 02:09:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does not do that for me...
Tue Oct  1 02:10:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, it should not be able to... that just actually exits that window
Tue Oct  1 02:10:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bah, that was probably some netscape bug
Tue Oct  1 02:10:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:exit from session just gets rid of the window... the applet is still running
Tue Oct  1 02:12:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this will also run as a standalone app when done
Tue Oct  1 02:12:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java app though, meaning you need a a JVM
Tue Oct  1 02:14:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the idea is that eventually all administrative tasks would be handled from that applet
Tue Oct  1 02:16:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not quite :)
Tue Oct  1 02:16:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more like banishing players, adming admins, changing security
Tue Oct  1 02:18:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is it a cre character?
Tue Oct  1 02:18:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not me
Tue Oct  1 02:19:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I had a cre character on RoD
Tue Oct  1 02:19:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wrote their mailer
Tue Oct  1 02:20:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not write the old discworld mailer
Tue Oct  1 02:20:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a completely different for RoD
Tue Oct  1 02:21:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Tue Oct  1 02:21:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:which still begs the question how did someone get onto RoD with my name?
Tue Oct  1 02:23:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, I am off to bed
Tue Oct  1 02:23:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:goodd night all
Tue Oct  1 02:24:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I would be insane to try to get a copyright on comeone else's name
Tue Oct  1 02:24:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:err trademark
Tue Oct  1 02:24:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:not everyone knows me :)
Tue Oct  1 02:25:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:DB I do run an open mud :)
Tue Oct  1 02:25:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:old and open :)
Tue Oct  1 02:25:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:but still...
Tue Oct  1 11:53:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many people receive wrong number faxes :(
Tue Oct  1 13:46:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:javascript != java
Tue Oct  1 13:47:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what's up your ass?
Tue Oct  1 13:49:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what about it?
Tue Oct  1 13:50:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I thought someone put together a package for it
Tue Oct  1 13:52:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well... does it support TCP/IP?
Tue Oct  1 13:53:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have something that receives but not sends?
Tue Oct  1 13:57:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kalypso?
Tue Oct  1 14:27:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what is the error you get?
Tue Oct  1 14:30:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... that does not say much :(
Tue Oct  1 14:33:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't have time for that... and I think i am out of my league in amylaar
Tue Oct  1 14:33:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry :(
Tue Oct  1 14:35:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have not every really used amylaar :0
Tue Oct  1 14:36:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the question is why bother?
Tue Oct  1 14:36:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, a while() loop that examines each char
Tue Oct  1 14:37:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, use replace_string()
Tue Oct  1 14:37:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for any double char? or a specific double char?
Tue Oct  1 14:37:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, replace_string()
Tue Oct  1 14:38:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:while( strsrch(str', ",,") str = replace_string(str, ",,", ",");
Tue Oct  1 14:39:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, you know what I mean
Tue Oct  1 14:39:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:while ,, exists in the string, rpelace it with ,
Tue Oct  1 16:05:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not a useful soluation
Wed Oct  2 00:55:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone on IVr2.6 tried adding races or classes yet?
Wed Oct  2 00:55:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it crashes the mud, ignore it
Wed Oct  2 00:56:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nothing you do will fix it
Wed Oct  2 00:56:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:addrace and addclass
Wed Oct  2 00:56:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do help on addclass
Wed Oct  2 00:56:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the to works fine for me
Wed Oct  2 00:58:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Wed Oct  2 00:58:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by then my GUI front end will be in place ;)
Wed Oct  2 00:59:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you must have done something such that someone is not alive
Wed Oct  2 01:00:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you must have modified something there
Wed Oct  2 01:00:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am a consultant and author
Wed Oct  2 01:01:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am using NM
Wed Oct  2 01:01:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have contributed to two books, writing one of my own, and some magazine articles
Wed Oct  2 01:03:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:are you using pure IVr2.6?
Wed Oct  2 01:03:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:so far everything you are reporting is not true of here
Wed Oct  2 01:03:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls::)
Wed Oct  2 01:04:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes... but was it mixed in with existing stuff from your IVr2.5 mud?
Wed Oct  2 01:04:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Wed Oct  2 01:05:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I see that bug here
Wed Oct  2 01:05:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well... what to bring over is a hard question to answer
Wed Oct  2 01:05:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I recommend playing with the new system and getting a good feel for what has changed
Wed Oct  2 01:06:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that is the problem with leaving so much time between releases... people have had some time to get some stuff done
Wed Oct  2 01:06:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:IVr3 though will be this weekend :)
Wed Oct  2 01:06:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:oh yeah
Wed Oct  2 01:06:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:everything in /realms /secure/cfg /domains should be copied over into IVr2.6
Wed Oct  2 01:09:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:people are welcome to be cres on Dead Souls to see what is being done here... this will be the official NM support site
Wed Oct  2 01:10:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes, IVr3 will be this weekend
Wed Oct  2 01:11:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no :) you canm just see what is up :)
Wed Oct  2 01:17:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Wed Oct  2 01:17:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it will be packaged with it
Wed Oct  2 01:19:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you will need a Java enabled browser
Wed Oct  2 01:22:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the exit works fine... it was your rbowser there
Wed Oct  2 01:23:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and your OS?
Wed Oct  2 01:24:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trust me... exit is not a complex operation, and according to the Java VM it CANNOT affect your browser
Wed Oct  2 01:24:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I use 3.0 Gold, but on Win905
Wed Oct  2 01:24:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bingo
Wed Oct  2 01:25:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it should
Wed Oct  2 01:29:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any ssscanf masters out there?
Wed Oct  2 01:32:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I need to parse #define BLAH 0
Wed Oct  2 01:33:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:where either a tab or space + other tabs or spaces separate BLAH and 0
Wed Oct  2 01:34:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:LPC
Wed Oct  2 01:35:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:reg_assoc() works on an array and gives you ones with matching pattersn
Wed Oct  2 01:35:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I want the BLAH
Wed Oct  2 01:36:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:BLAH and 0 are place holdres
Wed Oct  2 14:18:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes... unfortunately I shipped the mud with clone unable to read /realms
Wed Oct  2 14:19:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it needs only read access
Wed Oct  2 14:19:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:clone should probably be stuck in /secure/cmds anyways
Wed Oct  2 14:22:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:only one
Wed Oct  2 14:23:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I code for only one mud
Wed Oct  2 14:26:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am on a lot of muds
Wed Oct  2 14:26:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:JavaMud, IdeaExchange, Dead Souls, Lima Bean, Nightmare, Igor, Phoenix
Wed Oct  2 14:26:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what's your point?
Wed Oct  2 14:26:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Servo it really varies
Wed Oct  2 14:27:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:always
Wed Oct  2 14:37:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because I did not filter it
Wed Oct  2 14:38:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no idea
Wed Oct  2 14:40:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I don't either :)
Wed Oct  2 14:41:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the former would be a NM bug, the latter a mudos bug
Wed Oct  2 14:41:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:hmm... the latter seems impossible
Wed Oct  2 14:41:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:night
Wed Oct  2 14:46:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not doubt you :) I was just saying it should be impossible :)
Wed Oct  2 14:58:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Wed Oct  2 14:59:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:intermud mail is planned

Wed Oct  2 19:54:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:updtate the help command
Wed Oct  2 19:54:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks... do you find the config file a pain?
Wed Oct  2 19:55:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, I have a web applet with IVr3 that will make it even easier
Wed Oct  2 20:00:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:who cares
Wed Oct  2 20:01:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well ask on intergossip
Wed Oct  2 20:01:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and the answer is still who cares
Wed Oct  2 20:30:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:EOTL is only populated by complete assholes
Wed Oct  2 21:01:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rm /save/classes.o
Wed Oct  2 21:01:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and readd everything
Wed Oct  2 22:41:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:are should not be a singular
Wed Oct  2 22:42:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:YOU made a big deal out of it being wrong :)
Wed Oct  2 22:42:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:given that it is not wrong...
Wed Oct  2 22:44:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:is it a quake rule that you have to be a complete loser to enjoy the game these days?
Wed Oct  2 22:46:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Wed Oct  2 22:47:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Wed Oct  2 22:48:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:whatever floats your boat
Wed Oct  2 22:48:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:IVr3 will not use anything from the v23 series
Wed Oct  2 23:41:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is modular
Wed Oct  2 23:41:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a mud just happens to be a very nterconnected system
Wed Oct  2 23:42:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:they are not
Wed Oct  2 23:42:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:races are no longer coded into the system
Wed Oct  2 23:44:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ciao would do guilds and races with shadows eh?
Wed Oct  2 23:45:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grab the mudlib and stick teh files int
Wed Oct  2 23:46:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which question?
Wed Oct  2 23:47:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:races are stored in configuration files
Thu Oct  3 00:10:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update /daemon/intermud.c
Thu Oct  3 10:49:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no

Thu Oct  3 10:50:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eval has never removed during an error
Thu Oct  3 10:50:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:otherwise you cannot see what you did wrong
Thu Oct  3 10:56:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it writes the error text... but you might wantt to view the source
Thu Oct  3 12:06:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Zac, move_object() cannot move otherobjects

Thu Oct  3 23:27:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:relatively speaking :)

Fri Oct  4 19:24:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Fri Oct  4 19:25:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am checking on it now
Fri Oct  4 19:29:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that looks like it is a fix
Fri Oct  4 19:31:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would not have been there originally
Fri Oct  4 19:40:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it gives people something to argue about
Fri Oct  4 21:00:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:X-Files is gettng old
Fri Oct  4 21:02:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes, well, the just missin out on the truth thing is getting really old
Fri Oct  4 21:34:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Ciao, you have the attitude of a complete ignorant
Fri Oct  4 23:04:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what non-crasher bugs have people experienced?
Fri Oct  4 23:05:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Fri Oct  4 23:06:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:whisper and ask?
Fri Oct  4 23:07:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what do you mean by didn't work
Fri Oct  4 23:16:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what happened with the bug anyways?
Fri Oct  4 23:25:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:there is no bug... the error4 message sucks big time
Fri Oct  4 23:27:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:right
Fri Oct  4 23:27:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:on't speak the same language
Fri Oct  4 23:29:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:hmm, that ,ay not be it then
Fri Oct  4 23:30:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Fri Oct  4 23:31:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM has a function
Fri Oct  4 23:52:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:can anyone name any more bugs?
Fri Oct  4 23:52:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Bob is a bug, dunno what Wilbur is :)
Sat Oct  5 00:56:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM people: please ell me what bugs you know about bsides ask, whisper, give
Sat Oct  5 10:01:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which mud?
Sat Oct  5 10:02:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which mud?
Sat Oct  5 10:03:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which mud?
Sat Oct  5 10:03:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I will come have a look it, what i the address?
Sat Oct  5 10:10:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Sat Oct  5 10:10:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that would have no meaning :)
Sat Oct  5 10:16:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:query_night()
Sat Oct  5 11:29:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Nightmare IVr3 will be released in about 1/2 hour
Sat Oct  5 11:31:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no nw featues./.. there will b no more new features for NM V
Sat Oct  5 11:31:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:why does it suck?
Sat Oct  5 11:32:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:that is not pueblo you dork
Sat Oct  5 11:33:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, it is not, that is the mud you are on
Sat Oct  5 11:34:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the sensitive mind thing is a 2.4.5 error nessage
Sat Oct  5 11:46:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:ok, well IVr3 is now available... again, no new features, just a bunch of bug fixes
Sat Oct  5 20:27:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:is anyone experiencng problems with NM IVr3?
Sat Oct  5 20:28:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:for example?
Sat Oct  5 20:30:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it would not be in the initial preloads
Sat Oct  5 20:30:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:just
Sat Oct  5 20:30:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is just probably the way you logged into your system
Sat Oct  5 20:30:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:you probably got it before any time something loads
Sat Oct  5 20:30:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:you just did not notice
Sat Oct  5 20:31:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:but that is a mudos problem anyways, and it does not affect the system
Sat Oct  5 20:31:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I need to know about NM IVr3 bugs
Sat Oct  5 20:31:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:that would be why you did not see it before :)
Sat Oct  5 20:32:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:at any rate, anyone encountered bugs with it?
Sat Oct  5 20:33:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I did not forget
Sat Oct  5 20:33:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I state quite explicitly than only a few races are included
Sat Oct  5 20:34:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:artrells and klingons are there to make sure everything in /domains/Ylsrim works
Sat Oct  5 20:34:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:not that I noticed... but if there are, I would need to add elves
Sat Oct  5 20:35:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:ok
Sat Oct  5 20:35:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, guess that will gointo NM IVr4
Sat Oct  5 20:40:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it means you implement the interfaces it doe snot if it is abstract
Sat Oct  5 20:41:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:specifically you can refer to it as an object of the type of interface it implements
Sat Oct  5 20:42:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I assume you mean X implements Y and you have Z which extends X?
Sat Oct  5 20:43:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Tim? :)
Sat Oct  5 20:43:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, if X i not abstract, it must implement the Y interfaces
Sat Oct  5 20:44:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:if it is abstract, it may or may not implement any... any it doesnot implement, Z needs to implement
Sat Oct  5 20:46:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no... you are only getting a cat exception because it is not a Z
Sat Oct  5 20:48:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:class cast means specifically that you are attempting to cast something it is not
Sat Oct  5 20:49:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:one sec phone
Sat Oct  5 21:09:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:back :) I need to experiment with that problem
Sat Oct  5 21:10:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Sat Oct  5 21:12:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:actually, I know for a fact that should not be a problem, I do it a lot
Sat Oct  5 21:13:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:for example, a room extends Holder which implements container
Sat Oct  5 21:14:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:then in the room, it does something like room = (Container)Server.createObject(exit);
Sat Oct  5 21:15:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:hmm... for debugging purposes...
Sat Oct  5 21:15:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:try stiocking in an if( x instanceof y ) {...
Sat Oct  5 21:16:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and then printingout ob.getClass().getName()
Sun Oct  6 12:33:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:so what sort of insanity is occurring today?
Sun Oct  6 13:11:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:there is a reason there are no more LPMud
Sun Oct  6 13:12:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and Archon I would hardly hold up as an example of anything good
Sun Oct  6 13:13:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:anything can become good with a few dozen good coders
Sun Oct  6 13:13:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:a few dozen good coders is not a simple commodity
Sun Oct  6 15:18:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it should not be complicated
Sun Oct  6 15:20:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bugs in it do not affect the ease of coding it
Sun Oct  6 15:27:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the problem with other door systems is that a mud is an OO system
Sun Oct  6 15:27:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and failing to treat a door as a real object is fucking up the metaphor
Sun Oct  6 15:35:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:IVr2.6 removed classes and races and created a separate configuration system for adding them so they are not hard coded
Sun Oct  6 15:37:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Despair: nothing that really concerns you
Sun Oct  6 15:37:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Zackron I have not had the time recently
Sun Oct  6 15:58:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Nightmare itself isopen
Sun Oct  6 16:07:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am unable toduplicate the problems you are mentioning
Sun Oct  6 16:08:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:can you give me a specific example of where a door is not working?
Sun Oct  6 16:08:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:from the Ylsrim domain?
Sun Oct  6 16:20:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Vashkar?
Sun Oct  6 17:08:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes.... I cannot duplicate a single problem you mentioned
Sun Oct  6 17:09:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:two of the bugs you reprtoed, while technically bugs, have no affect on the way the system rns
Sun Oct  6 17:10:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:also... you misunderstand the cncept of lockable, though you make a good point
Sun Oct  6 17:10:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:a door can have no key but still be lockable
Sun Oct  6 17:10:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:however, it should be base don side
Sun Oct  6 17:10:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and rightnow doors are lockable as a whole or not at all
Sun Oct  6 17:11:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I need a better descrip[tion of what is causing you problems
Sun Oct  6 17:11:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:right
Sun Oct  6 17:11:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you set lockable
Sun Oct  6 17:18:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, that suggests you modified the code :)
Sun Oct  6 17:21:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the code that passes a key objectis /verbs/items/unlock.c
Sun Oct  6 17:22:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, you see, that won't pass without a key
Sun Oct  6 17:23:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you modified somthing affecting this system
Sun Oct  6 17:23:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because unlocking doors works just fine here
Sun Oct  6 17:23:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Sun Oct  6 17:24:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it goes through room.c and door.c
Sun Oct  6 17:25:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:actually, I bet I know what the problem is...
Sun Oct  6 17:25:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you understanding of the return codes from evenWhatever() is all wrong
Sun Oct  6 17:25:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the return codes are right
Sun Oct  6 17:25:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:your changing them probably messed that all up
Sun Oct  6 17:26:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:at any rate, all I can ell you is that unlocking doors works fine on the doors shipped with the lib
Sun Oct  6 17:26:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:which is correct
Sun Oct  6 17:27:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:but failure in the command sense
Sun Oct  6 17:27:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:which for an event method is catastrophic failure
Sun Oct  6 17:27:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:not that opening the door failed
Sun Oct  6 17:27:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:catastrophic failure is that something is hugely wrong with the system and all of the data is not cohrent
Sun Oct  6 17:28:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:oh well, when in doubt, RTFS
Sun Oct  6 17:29:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the source is always right
Sun Oct  6 17:29:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the return value for eventOpen() has no effecton what happens
Sun Oct  6 17:29:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is simply a signal to the parser
Sun Oct  6 17:31:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:GetClosed() simply tells you the status of the door
Sun Oct  6 17:31:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:eventOpen() ALWAYS opens the door
Sun Oct  6 17:32:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it cannot fail to open the door
Sun Oct  6 17:32:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:untless something is really wrong
Sun Oct  6 17:32:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:which has nothing to do with the user, but whether the code is fucked up
Sun Oct  6 17:33:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:CanOpen() determines whether you can open it or not
Sun Oct  6 17:35:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins/Parser
Sun Oct  6 17:38:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the latest lynx supports frames
Sun Oct  6 17:39:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Dead Souls lists all canges made
Sun Oct  6 17:39:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:AddSkillPoints()
Sun Oct  6 17:42:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:tables suck in the old one
Sun Oct  6 17:43:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:but I know the new one supports frames
Sun Oct  6 17:47:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you are right, in that it is proper practice to do so
Sun Oct  6 17:47:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:however, it actualy makesno difference since this_player() is always who
Sun Oct  6 17:49:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:if(Skills[skill]["class"] == 1) ResetLevel()
Sun Oct  6 18:09:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:showtree CanOpen /lib/door
Sun Oct  6 18:21:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:fuckVashkarHard
Sun Oct  6 18:21:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:hey! That did not work!
Sun Oct  6 18:24:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I for one don't give a damn what your sexual orientaion is
Sun Oct  6 18:25:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that colloqial expression generally means VashkarIsAJerk
Sun Oct  6 18:25:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:not that I am interested in fucking you
Sun Oct  6 18:25:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you should not flatter yourself so
Sun Oct  6 18:26:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:probably my fault this time
Sun Oct  6 18:41:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:damn Uthcaltha, what part of ALPHA don't you understand?
Sun Oct  6 18:43:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:so far, I have not had any big bug reports for the beta
Sun Oct  6 18:43:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:damn near release candidate if i had enough docs
Sun Oct  6 18:44:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:beta.tar.gz is not obvious enough for you?
Sun Oct  6 18:46:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:why dn't you not be an asshole with the first words out of your mouth "this lib is buggy"
Sun Oct  6 18:47:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because nitwits like you
Sun Oct  6 18:48:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, you are also using an old version of the lib, which means I eally don't give a fuck where
Sun Oct  6 18:49:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I have a lot more tolerence for someone who says "why doesn't help work" than someone who says "this lib is buggy"
Sun Oct  6 18:50:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you get equally numb Lima users, and much more numb TMI-2 users... it is just ratios that is a problem
Sun Oct  6 18:52:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:anyone got the new cellular digital PCS phones?
Sun Oct  6 18:52:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:unlimited free airtime for 6 months
Sun Oct  6 18:53:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the phone just cost me $230
Sun Oct  6 18:53:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:airtime is cheaper than analog
Sun Oct  6 18:53:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the plan I will be on is 30 minutes free, .35 peak, .15 off peak
Sun Oct  6 18:54:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the thing has caller id, voice encryption, voice mail
Sun Oct  6 18:54:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, Nokia
Sun Oct  6 18:55:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:AT&T service
Sun Oct  6 18:55:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I think those are the only combination that has it
Sun Oct  6 19:00:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:30 minutes/month
Sun Oct  6 19:00:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:only AT&T has this digital PCS thing
Sun Oct  6 20:04:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:they are whatever you make them to be for your mud
Sun Oct  6 20:05:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:why worry about other people's ideas of what a monk is supposed to be... a mud should be a creative endeavour
Sun Oct  6 20:06:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the most annoying thing anyone can say to me on NM is "monks are not supposed to be able to do that"
Sun Oct  6 20:06:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, I already know who I am voting for
Sun Oct  6 20:07:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:you can't go what all alone?
Sun Oct  6 20:07:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:america is about reminding the British how inept they are
Sun Oct  6 20:08:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:better than plain-=spanking
Sun Oct  6 20:25:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:err, no
Sun Oct  6 20:25:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:this is not C
Sun Oct  6 20:26:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:LPC is nothing like C
Sun Oct  6 20:26:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a string *
Sun Oct  6 20:26:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:string * is not a porinter to a string
Sun Oct  6 20:26:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:string * should not be used on a NM mud
Sun Oct  6 20:26:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:should be declared string array
Sun Oct  6 20:27:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there are no pointers
Sun Oct  6 20:27:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:string * is string array
Sun Oct  6 20:28:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:why are you using parse_command()?
Sun Oct  6 20:28:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:parse_command() is not used by SetRules()
Sun Oct  6 20:29:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, given that I wrote SetRules(), I think I know what it uses
Sun Oct  6 20:29:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, it will not
Sun Oct  6 20:29:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:STR at OBJ with OBJ
Sun Oct  6 20:30:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:#1 forget you ever heard of C
Sun Oct  6 20:30:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:STR at OBJ with OBJ
Sun Oct  6 20:30:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that is what you need in SetRules()
Sun Oct  6 20:31:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:next, what exactly is your problem?
Sun Oct  6 20:31:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the string youmentioned clearly will not work
Sun Oct  6 20:32:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:but you have not explained what the problem was other than trying to solve the problem by turning LPC into C
Sun Oct  6 20:32:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:SetRules("STR at LIV with OBJ")
Sun Oct  6 20:33:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or perhaps SetRules("WRD at LIV with OBJ"
Sun Oct  6 20:33:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, you want different responses with a sword
Sun Oct  6 20:34:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it *is* a different rule
Sun Oct  6 20:34:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there are several reasons which boil down to simplicity why that might not be a goodidea...
Sun Oct  6 20:34:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:#1 you can have only one OBS token in a rule
Sun Oct  6 20:35:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Claire, doesn't matter
Sun Oct  6 20:35:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you still want toprocess LIV different than OBJ
Sun Oct  6 20:35:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because the parser only allows one OBS per rule
Sun Oct  6 20:35:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes Claie, but then you lose the power of the parser
Sun Oct  6 20:36:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a better way is to still use cast, but create spells with individual rules
Sun Oct  6 20:36:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you can centralize spell management, but still keep the power of the parser
Sun Oct  6 20:37:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Claire, you don't even udnerstand your way
Sun Oct  6 20:38:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am trying to help you here
Sun Oct  6 20:38:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because of what the parser can know at a given time
Sun Oct  6 20:38:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:one OBS or LVS
Sun Oct  6 20:39:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:take for example the command get swords from chests
Sun Oct  6 20:39:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:as many OBJ as you want, up to 10 tokens
Sun Oct  6 20:42:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Sun Oct  6 20:42:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because you do not duplicate OBS and OBJ rules
Sun Oct  6 20:44:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and your spell names are more than just single worlds?
Sun Oct  6 20:46:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no version of NM has a debug.log
Sun Oct  6 20:47:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, no NM IV vrsion
Sun Oct  6 20:54:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:really
Sun Oct  6 20:54:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what if you don't know you have the key?
Sun Oct  6 20:55:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but a "key" is not always a key
Sun Oct  6 20:55:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what if the "key" is actually a magical item unlocking a magically sealed door?
Sun Oct  6 20:56:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you do not know that you have the so called thing, so you do not use it
Sun Oct  6 20:57:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not think unlock is excessive :)
Sun Oct  6 21:18:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you did not say an error
Sun Oct  6 21:19:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no idea, you only stated a small part of it
Sun Oct  6 21:20:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for some reason IVr3 ismissing smell.c
Sun Oct  6 21:20:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smell.h
Sun Oct  6 21:21:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:err, no
Sun Oct  6 21:22:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:wrong include file
Sun Oct  6 21:22:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:/lib/include/smell.h belongsin /lib/include
Sun Oct  6 21:23:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is still very wrong :)
Sun Oct  6 21:24:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:grab this one
Sun Oct  6 21:24:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is small enough to get in a screen capture
Sun Oct  6 21:28:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and you all think i have time to send it around? :) come here and get it yourself :)
Sun Oct  6 21:28:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Sun Oct  6 21:29:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:missing?
Sun Oct  6 21:29:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:they would only have been missing if you removed them :)
Sun Oct  6 21:30:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:someone there removed them :)
Sun Oct  6 21:31:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:oh, you mean Add as opposed to Set
Sun Oct  6 21:32:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there isno need for an Add
Sun Oct  6 21:32:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:why?
Sun Oct  6 21:33:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:use Set for that
Sun Oct  6 21:33:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:use it again
Sun Oct  6 21:34:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:why do you need another function when the onbe that exists already does what you want?
Sun Oct  6 21:34:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:exits work vry differently
Sun Oct  6 21:34:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no one said you had to define the rest
Sun Oct  6 21:35:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:SetSmell("whatever", (: mthd :))
Sun Oct  6 22:04:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Claire you would not have gotten an rror with that
Sun Oct  6 22:12:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the conrol character is your problem :)
Sun Oct  6 22:16:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I mean, you added it in transport... it was not in the file here
Sun Oct  6 22:33:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:like sitting there killing monsters ovr and over?
Sun Oct  6 22:34:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:haling when not injured is not right
Sun Oct  6 22:41:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I do not understand
Sun Oct  6 22:46:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I don't think I understand the queston
Sun Oct  6 22:46:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you have a string and you want to see which object matches that string, but not necessarily a rule
Mon Oct  7 09:06:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:catch_tell() should not be used in a NM lib
Mon Oct  7 09:14:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cause NM has a better syste,
Mon Oct  7 09:15:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, shit, why else would I tell people not to use the old system with NM?
Mon Oct  7 09:16:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the sentients
Mon Oct  7 09:16:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a NM 3 issue though :)
Mon Oct  7 09:17:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:an inheritable in NM IV that allows you to respond to user actions
Mon Oct  7 09:17:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think that of people who make stupid statements like yours
Mon Oct  7 09:18:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your critique of me saying the new NM system for responding to user actions is better than the old
Mon Oct  7 09:19:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is actually a statement about people's knowledge of the mudlibs out there
Mon Oct  7 09:20:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is why your critique is so stupid
Mon Oct  7 09:20:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specifically cause i was reechoing Pinkfish
Mon Oct  7 09:21:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no response to that inane comment
Mon Oct  7 09:22:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever... that there is what is stupid by the way
Mon Oct  7 09:22:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:making baseless generalizations ina derogatory fashion
Mon Oct  7 09:23:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:better than being an eye dropper
Mon Oct  7 09:25:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not crunchy?
Mon Oct  7 09:26:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though frog texture belopngs on intergossip :)
Mon Oct  7 09:26:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what an asshole
Mon Oct  7 09:26:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is that what you want?
Mon Oct  7 09:27:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one in the same
Mon Oct  7 09:28:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:losers always flame typos
Mon Oct  7 09:29:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I prefer robin's vomit to lark's vomit
Mon Oct  7 09:31:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not that I am interested in what Reflex has to say, but as Xavier stated, this is a gossip line
Mon Oct  7 09:32:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hello
Mon Oct  7 09:33:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is still nice to know that what ou have on your mind is attacking me for helping someone else
Mon Oct  7 09:51:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the reason you were called an idiot is because you were attacking me, not being silly like Pinkfish
Mon Oct  7 09:51:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and attacking me at of nowhere for no reason
Mon Oct  7 09:52:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, a :> mkes it all bette then
Mon Oct  7 09:52:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the stuff you do Pinkfish :)
Mon Oct  7 09:54:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:test
Mon Oct  7 09:55:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too easy? how many people you have taking cheap shots at you for helping others Reflex?
Mon Oct  7 09:55:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't imagine too many
Mon Oct  7 09:55:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means you haven't a fucking clue
Mon Oct  7 09:56:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is what I think of it you twit
Mon Oct  7 09:58:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am fucking sick of this shit
Mon Oct  7 09:58:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it is bringing me damn close to not helping people
Mon Oct  7 09:58:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gotta love the person who defends being a jerk because "I should not get upset about it"
Mon Oct  7 09:59:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it makes no ifference to me, still the am,e shit
Mon Oct  7 10:00:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's a stupid nonsequitur
Mon Oct  7 10:00:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do muds becase I do like helping people
Mon Oct  7 10:00:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if helping people just gets me grief, then screw it
Mon Oct  7 10:03:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Reflex, now, I doubt anyone would argye that I am nothelp
Mon Oct  7 10:04:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if that is your argument, I think i just died on that statement
Mon Oct  7 10:04:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rhaje: you are not in my position
Mon Oct  7 10:07:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:pot calling the kettle black
Mon Oct  7 10:07:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am tired of all the baseless flames
Mon Oct  7 10:07:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of people making slams at me just cause I say something on Intermud
Mon Oct  7 10:07:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have better thins to do
Mon Oct  7 10:09:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:damn desktop keyboards
Mon Oct  7 10:10:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:please
Mon Oct  7 10:12:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah... please give me an xample, i do not think I understand
Mon Oct  7 10:13:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud is going in spurts today
Mon Oct  7 10:13:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, NM chooses to log that data so you can get it
Mon Oct  7 10:14:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LOCALS_IN_TRACEBACK should be defined
Mon Oct  7 10:14:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/log/runtime
Mon Oct  7 10:15:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:pushing it on you?
Mon Oct  7 10:17:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it makes you hapy, I will add a claue in the license that you may never use the lib in any form and no mud which you are part of may use it
Mon Oct  7 10:18:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Panther: that does not boil down to me saying every mudlib is crap... it bpoils down to me saying TMI-2 and Heaven 7 are
Mon Oct  7 10:18:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and unlike most people, I provide arguments to back up that statement
Mon Oct  7 10:19:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and generally, I use the word crap in the context of a more heated debate than randm "it is crap comments"
Mon Oct  7 10:19:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not at all Panther
Mon Oct  7 10:19:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Reflex
Mon Oct  7 10:19:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is up to you not to take cheap shots at anyone
Mon Oct  7 10:20:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, in the way e should be treated, no, but in reality that is not the case reflex
Mon Oct  7 10:20:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Suvangi is Discworld
Mon Oct  7 10:22:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in reality, a newbie from AOL oes not have software being used by hundreds of people
Mon Oct  7 10:22:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:login to Dead Souls
Mon Oct  7 10:23:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one is suggesting you should treat Beek or I like gods or any different than anyone else
Mon Oct  7 10:23:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is being suggested is #1 ou don't treat ANYONE with cheap shots
Mon Oct  7 10:24:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and #2 that the effect of your cheap shots on people writing free software can be greatr than that on a AOL newbie
Mon Oct  7 10:25:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you running the wndows vrsion? or a UNIX release?
Mon Oct  7 10:25:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:change the mudos.cfg file with it
Mon Oct  7 10:26:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, you can't run NM with the discworld driver
Mon Oct  7 10:26:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, well, naming of the debug.l0og file is in the mud cnfig fil
Mon Oct  7 10:32:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek wrote most of the NM error handler code, xcept for compat busters which came after
Mon Oct  7 10:36:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, I certainly would not stop development of NM because of you.
Mon Oct  7 10:37:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what might cause me to stop doing NM, however, is a continuous slamming every day
Mon Oct  7 10:41:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bullshit
Mon Oct  7 10:41:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you made a negative, irrelevant statement out of the blue
Mon Oct  7 10:43:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:aha! so Pinkfish is a guinea pig!
Mon Oct  7 10:45:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I prsonally like mint chocolate chip, but I have been known to like straweberry next to mint chocalate chip!
Mon Oct  7 10:46:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at least I am not a guinea pig
Mon Oct  7 10:48:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wuld argue he can't se himself
Mon Oct  7 11:08:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the former
Mon Oct  7 11:09:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:$($($($(x))))
Mon Oct  7 13:38:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what a pig
Mon Oct  7 13:41:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are concerned about mudlib + driver disk space, you are in shit
Mon Oct  7 13:41:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the real isk space is in the mud
Mon Oct  7 13:46:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the dutch
Mon Oct  7 13:47:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but if I pull my fnger out of the dike, the town will flood!
Mon Oct  7 13:48:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fear a mad dutchman
Mon Oct  7 13:50:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:None of the ales are alive.
Mon Oct  7 13:52:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is a tmi-2 copy
Mon Oct  7 19:41:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not acting as a result of your wqill
Mon Oct  7 19:42:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct  7 19:42:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means an agent who acts without raional cause
Mon Oct  7 19:43:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, eval return objects()
Mon Oct  7 19:44:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct  7 19:45:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what part of that demonstrates lack of rational cause?
Mon Oct  7 20:13:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:exciting evening
Mon Oct  7 21:01:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:a NM nadmin tool equivalent will be part of NM VI's first alpha in the form of a web applet
Mon Oct  7 21:08:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes?
Mon Oct  7 21:09:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:man objects
Mon Oct  7 21:16:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what version of NM?
Mon Oct  7 21:17:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM 3?
Mon Oct  7 21:17:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:ok... you using the arce template files?
Mon Oct  7 21:17:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:race
Mon Oct  7 21:18:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what does your wing line look like?
Mon Oct  7 21:20:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that does not follow the xamples :)
Mon Oct  7 21:20:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you forgot armour types
Mon Oct  7 21:21:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:should end with a :
Mon Oct  7 21:28:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Silvyar, ae you totally dense?
Mon Oct  7 21:28:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:we have gone over this a billion times... the give problem is a driver bug
Mon Oct  7 21:29:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:thanks, that makes it all better
Mon Oct  7 21:31:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:b17 is released?
Mon Oct  7 21:32:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, that is the "give" bug
Mon Oct  7 21:33:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:once the release is official, I will release NM IVr4
Mon Oct  7 21:34:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM IV users: what is the most poorly documented piece of the mudlib right now that drives you themost nuts?
Mon Oct  7 21:36:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:there are 40 muds on this line using NM IV
Mon Oct  7 21:36:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and enough of you find time to criticize without reason, why miss the chane to do it with reason when I ask for it?
Mon Oct  7 21:37:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that point of viw is useful... what have you tried to do that has been difficult because no examples/docs
Mon Oct  7 21:38:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:settng up which dirs?
Mon Oct  7 21:39:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:missng dirs are bugs
Mon Oct  7 21:42:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I think you all have been very helpful
Mon Oct  7 21:42:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:and Aristotle, it is not a NM bug :)
Mon Oct  7 21:43:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the best answer this morning as that it was a driver bug you could do nothing about
Mon Oct  7 21:43:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the best answer now is that it is fixed in MudOS v22b17 :)
Mon Oct  7 21:44:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Mon Oct  7 21:44:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:shadow this is I3
Mon Oct  7 21:49:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:ethen your ISP is stupid and has no business being an ISP
Mon Oct  7 23:36:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Kalypso, take it elsewhere

Mon Oct  7 23:41:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you are n europe, ftp-ue will be faster
Mon Oct  7 23:41:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:west coast usa, ftp3
Mon Oct  7 23:41:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:err I mean southeast
Mon Oct  7 23:41:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:midwest ftp1
Mon Oct  7 23:42:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:west coast ftp4
Mon Oct  7 23:42:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is a vry rugh approximation
Mon Oct  7 23:42:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:do you have the administrative capacity over an ftp site? :)
Mon Oct  7 23:43:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:need to start the driver from that directory
Mon Oct  7 23:44:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you set up a mirror, I will add you an ftp-au entry and make you ftp5 and give you unlimited access privs
Mon Oct  7 23:45:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no permissions for it?
Mon Oct  7 23:45:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:really odd
Mon Oct  7 23:51:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, all you need is read on mudos.cfg
Mon Oct  7 23:53:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:base_name()
Tue Oct  8 00:20:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, I have redone the install web page... I believe it is completely idiot proof, however I would appreciate people who have installed NM to look at it and tell me if I missed any weird problems they might reasonably run into
Tue Oct  8 00:20:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins
Tue Oct  8 00:20:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:not really
Tue Oct  8 00:21:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I mean I need to see if the doc matches your install experiences
Tue Oct  8 00:21:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I apreciate it
Tue Oct  8 00:23:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I don't care about that... that is my next task :)
Tue Oct  8 00:24:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I need to get feedback on install right now :)
Tue Oct  8 00:25:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:like I said, that is a bug
Tue Oct  8 00:25:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you fix bugs, you don't document them
Tue Oct  8 00:26:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:intro as well please
Tue Oct  8 00:26:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:confused over what? where to telnet to?
Tue Oct  8 00:26:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Ex: csh is standard UNIX... that is so oddball as not to be worth the time :)
Tue Oct  8 00:28:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:okie Nippie
Tue Oct  8 00:28:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes, Darius, I should
Tue Oct  8 00:28:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:but people should not be using startmudos for long term management
Tue Oct  8 00:29:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:while( 1 ) { run } is not my idea of a robust script :)
Tue Oct  8 00:29:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I don't use UNIX scripting tools, I use python and perl
Tue Oct  8 00:29:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:neither of which I wnated to use for a startmudos sample program
Tue Oct  8 00:29:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:in interface.c
Tue Oct  8 00:30:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:corsair... cannot use looks?
Tue Oct  8 00:30:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the person probably aliased them to something goofy
Tue Oct  8 00:31:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there is nothing in common between who and look
Tue Oct  8 00:32:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:cd fixes that
Tue Oct  8 00:32:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am not adding any new featuresbefore NM V
Tue Oct  8 00:32:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:as trivial as that one is
Tue Oct  8 00:35:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, who does not distinguih
Tue Oct  8 00:35:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:arch/admin are ranks
Tue Oct  8 00:37:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you guys fucked with something big time :)
Tue Oct  8 00:40:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:right
Tue Oct  8 00:43:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I appreciate your time
Tue Oct  8 00:45:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that wuld imply that your cwd was no the dir in which startmudos was
Tue Oct  8 00:45:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or that another startmudos was earlier in your path
Tue Oct  8 00:46:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or that startmudos was not in the same dir as driver and mudos.cfg
Tue Oct  8 00:49:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yep
Tue Oct  8 00:51:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:which event functins?
Tue Oct  8 00:52:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:showtree eventDescribeEnvironment /lib/player
Tue Oct  8 00:54:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:eventPrint() override
Tue Oct  8 00:55:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:everywhere
Tue Oct  8 00:58:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:catch_tell(0 is not to be used on NM muds
Tue Oct  8 01:00:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:don't use tell_room() either
Tue Oct  8 01:00:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:override the room's eventPrint() method
Tue Oct  8 01:02:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:write an eventPrint() method that intercept what goes through it
Tue Oct  8 01:05:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it will capture everything sent through eventPrint() in the room
Tue Oct  8 01:12:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you pass it up to ::eventPrint()
Tue Oct  8 01:15:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no problem
Tue Oct  8 01:31:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:i have no idea, I did not write the colour system, Pinkfish did
Tue Oct  8 01:33:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM VI will suppot embedded pictures
Tue Oct  8 01:33:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:please check out the directory structure document now... it is done
Tue Oct  8 01:35:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:bingo
Tue Oct  8 01:36:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:is anyone looking at the directory structure documents?
Tue Oct  8 01:37:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins
Tue Oct  8 01:37:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:click on the directory structure doc
Tue Oct  8 01:41:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:ftp is not really pat of the lib
Tue Oct  8 01:43:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:any other comments? :)
Tue Oct  8 01:43:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:not sure what the latest is
Tue Oct  8 01:44:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:lynx supports frames
Tue Oct  8 01:44:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:thanks ex
Tue Oct  8 01:45:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:get a later version
Tue Oct  8 01:45:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it just does
Tue Oct  8 01:45:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you don't need to do anything
Tue Oct  8 01:45:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:just stick html filesin /www
Tue Oct  8 01:46:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and as I said, lynx does support frames
Tue Oct  8 01:46:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:i.e. you are wrong :)
Tue Oct  8 01:47:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I don't know what you missed, but the latest vrsion of netscape does in fact support frames
Tue Oct  8 01:48:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:lynx 2.6 supports frames
Tue Oct  8 01:49:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you should have big letters that say FRAME: NMUSEIDX at the top
Tue Oct  8 01:51:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:back to the original issue... any comments on the docs? :)
Tue Oct  8 01:52:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:thanks, then I am ff to bed :)
Tue Oct  8 09:34:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:(a) it is morning, and b) I am not happy
Tue Oct  8 09:35:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can't argue with a) since I am the one wishing good morning!
Tue Oct  8 09:36:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kasha BFD, Iam not where you are
Tue Oct  8 09:48:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what exactly is wrong with shops that people were complaining about earlier?
Tue Oct  8 09:51:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Darius weren't you complaining earlier about bugs in the lib???? what bugs exactly are there?
Tue Oct  8 09:52:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now there are 0 known bugs with the NM mudlib
Tue Oct  8 09:52:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is the first time in my life I can say that :)
Tue Oct  8 09:52:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Oct  8 09:53:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:runtime errors means you wrote some buggy code that you are trying to load :)
Tue Oct  8 09:53:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless you are running through Ylsrim, which is not done yet
Tue Oct  8 09:53:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Beyond too :)
Tue Oct  8 09:54:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Darius: what sort of runtime errors?
Tue Oct  8 09:54:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that is probably a bug in IVr3 with respect to not having an elf race
Tue Oct  8 09:55:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that one is already fixed on DS :)
Tue Oct  8 09:57:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie :)
Tue Oct  8 09:57:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so much for no known bugs :)
Tue Oct  8 09:57:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ant IVr4 to be a el;ease candidate... so I need even the sma;llest bug repots now
Tue Oct  8 09:59:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Oct  8 10:31:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Tue Oct  8 10:36:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, you don't clone it
Tue Oct  8 10:36:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the create command
Tue Oct  8 13:15:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:CMDS
Tue Oct  8 16:04:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any bugs?
Tue Oct  8 16:04:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Oct  8 16:05:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the problem?
Tue Oct  8 16:06:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make sure the line ends in :
Tue Oct  8 16:08:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, those are easy fixes for the next release
Tue Oct  8 16:08:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks
Tue Oct  8 16:25:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is privledges correct spelling?
Tue Oct  8 16:28:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Oct  8 16:29:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I would appreciate feedback on a new NM security document at http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins
Tue Oct  8 16:32:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:check your error logs
Tue Oct  8 16:34:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it almost certainly tells you exactly what the error is
Tue Oct  8 16:35:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, bing
Tue Oct  8 16:35:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there ya go
Tue Oct  8 16:35:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Tue Oct  8 16:36:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Despair drop the da,mn subjct
Tue Oct  8 16:36:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a bug, and I would rather spend my time FIXING thebug than writing documents about how to get aroudn them
Tue Oct  8 16:36:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not you Silvyar
Tue Oct  8 16:38:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I fail to see how it makes sense for me to write documents about things I should fix
Tue Oct  8 16:38:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks Tharic :)
Tue Oct  8 16:39:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://your.machine:htttp_port/
Tue Oct  8 16:40:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe the httpd is not running
Tue Oct  8 16:41:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:honestly, sound slike a personal problem :) the http daemon has been functional on many muds for years without a problem
Tue Oct  8 16:44:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well despair, check your error logs
Tue Oct  8 16:45:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, this is a system that has been running for 3 years now
Tue Oct  8 16:46:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probBLY /log/runtime
Tue Oct  8 16:47:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there ya go :)
Tue Oct  8 16:48:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the httpd is NOT designed to replace NCSA, netscape, or MS
Tue Oct  8 16:48:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever Leto
Tue Oct  8 16:50:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the httpd is designed to provide a nice centralized location for mud information
Tue Oct  8 16:50:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not supposed to be a huge binary object server
Tue Oct  8 16:51:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for a mud environment, robust file handling isnot a necessity :)
Tue Oct  8 16:53:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bbiaf
Tue Oct  8 16:53:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the mean time, please look at that ecurity document :)
Tue Oct  8 17:34:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Oct  8 17:35:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that helps in itself :)
Tue Oct  8 17:44:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie, thanks :)
Tue Oct  8 17:44:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is a first?
Tue Oct  8 17:45:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I solicited comments on the new NM security doc
Tue Oct  8 17:47:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can't find what ypou are talking about ":)
Tue Oct  8 17:53:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Oct  8 17:56:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes

Tue Oct  8 18:56:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Tue Oct  8 18:57:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Tue Oct  8 18:58:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is a 3 year old pgm that predates win32 :)
Tue Oct  8 18:58:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Kalinashis working on a new version
Tue Oct  8 18:59:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:weill, it could be as simple as that if I had PB 5.0
Tue Oct  8 18:59:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I don' even have the source code any more :)
Tue Oct  8 19:09:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Nightmare IVr4 is now available... to my knowledge this has ZERO mudlib bugs (which of course willnot turnout to be the case)
Tue Oct  8 19:09:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it also includes a driver that fixes the give crasher
Tue Oct  8 19:10:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:if this elease turns out to be bug free, Nightmae V will be the next release once all docs are done and Ylsrim is done
Tue Oct  8 19:11:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:v22b17
Tue Oct  8 20:05:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls::)
Tue Oct  8 20:05:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:theinstall go ok?
Tue Oct  8 21:27:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what do ou mean by that question?
Tue Oct  8 21:27:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:v23.1a* isout
Tue Oct  8 21:27:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that is alpha stuff
Tue Oct  8 21:27:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:v22b13 is beta and thus more stable
Tue Oct  8 21:28:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:why do you want to telnt from inside the mud?
Tue Oct  8 21:29:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:man query_day()
Tue Oct  8 21:29:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:oops
Tue Oct  8 21:30:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, using cres is not really testinganything
Tue Oct  8 21:30:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:nightmare-mudlib@imaginary.com... like it saysin README.txt
Tue Oct  8 21:31:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because conceptualy a cre doe snot have a body
Tue Oct  8 21:31:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a creator is someone who codes
Tue Oct  8 21:31:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you disagree, then give them bodies, like Nippie said, it is not rocket science
Tue Oct  8 21:32:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:IMHO 10 cres sitting around taking up hb's is an immense waste of CPU processng
Tue Oct  8 21:34:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:depends on your system load
Tue Oct  8 21:35:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that would be my guess
Tue Oct  8 21:37:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a good clean up scheme makes more sense
Tue Oct  8 21:37:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM does not run a call out on rooms when you pass throw
Tue Oct  8 21:37:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:through
Tue Oct  8 21:38:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no call out, just let the driver clean up handle it

Tue Oct  8 23:03:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, that wuld be insecure
Tue Oct  8 23:03:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or maybe I do not understand
Tue Oct  8 23:05:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:can't do that
Tue Oct  8 23:07:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yep
Tue Oct  8 23:14:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Getname()( is almost always what you should use?
Tue Oct  8 23:15:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:GetCapName() almost never shouldbe used

Tue Oct  8 23:17:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:GetCapName() is a way to access their preferred capitalized name
Tue Oct  8 23:17:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:GetName() is the name as it should be displayed
Tue Oct  8 23:17:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it may or may not be unique or other things
Wed Oct  9 00:36:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what?
Wed Oct  9 00:38:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:nope, not getting anything
Wed Oct  9 00:42:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:driver efun, why do you want the code?

Wed Oct  9 11:05:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is all user interface stuff
Wed Oct  9 11:09:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM VI would not be released until like 1998 or 1999
Wed Oct  9 11:15:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:bcause I added the races last night at 2am
Wed Oct  9 11:18:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know... a little crasher, going to a begun version
Wed Oct  9 14:07:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not currently
Wed Oct  9 14:31:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:editing the level variable doe snothing
Wed Oct  9 14:31:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:level is a reflection of skill averages

Wed Oct  9 16:06:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think that sums up the flaws in people who take CNN to heart
Wed Oct  9 16:08:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds like a personal problem
Wed Oct  9 16:09:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because people are stupid does not mean you blame CNN :)
Wed Oct  9 16:10:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you start a news service that handles issues
Wed Oct  9 18:18:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Netscape is a flaming piece of shit!
Wed Oct  9 18:19:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one thing you can only see under NT 4.0 is that NS leaves litle rouge processes running
Wed Oct  9 18:19:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eventually they eat up all your cpu
Wed Oct  9 18:40:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does anyone know of a fax program for NT?
Wed Oct  9 18:43:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Wed Oct  9 18:43:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:delrina winfax does not run on nt
Wed Oct  9 18:44:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what do you mean part of NM code for loss of ense?
Wed Oct  9 18:46:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:MS Exchange does not have fax built in
Wed Oct  9 18:46:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, you can set the player to blind
Wed Oct  9 18:47:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the sight stuff

Wed Oct  9 18:52:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I just want some software
Wed Oct  9 18:53:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it wasn't even funny
Wed Oct  9 18:53:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was just stupid
Wed Oct  9 18:54:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bad luck or a stick up your ass
Wed Oct  9 18:55:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it won't :)(
Wed Oct  9 18:55:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:AFAIK

Wed Oct  9 18:57:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err bytes :)
Wed Oct  9 18:57:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Oct  9 19:11:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no ftp port
Wed Oct  9 19:11:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, no ftp port... ftp is a separate product

Wed Oct  9 21:00:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:direct is for that
Wed Oct  9 21:13:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:make them

Wed Oct  9 23:24:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I personally like the 64 kbps
Wed Oct  9 23:27:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:dedicated ISDN is like being a prmanent part of the net :)
Wed Oct  9 23:28:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that from an ISP
Wed Oct  9 23:28:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:shit, I will move to T1 or greater access by then :)
Wed Oct  9 23:31:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:as whom?
Wed Oct  9 23:42:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:whatever you make it
Wed Oct  9 23:42:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:there is no LP equivalent of anything, LP is baout a language
Wed Oct  9 23:43:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not in the NM mudlib,no
Wed Oct  9 23:44:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there is no such method
Wed Oct  9 23:45:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it probably would

Thu Oct 10 00:14:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you see them all
Thu Oct 10 00:15:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:must be set to 0
Thu Oct 10 00:16:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I think so
Thu Oct 10 00:17:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I really cannot speak to your situation except to say if they have the skill, it shows
Thu Oct 10 00:17:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Thu Oct 10 00:42:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:use ed
Thu Oct 10 00:50:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what do you mean?
Thu Oct 10 00:51:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:ok... though I am not really interested in bug report son that, that is a NM VI feature
Thu Oct 10 01:13:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:err, that is like one of the main docs in /doc/mudlib
Thu Oct 10 10:33:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:for...
Thu Oct 10 10:44:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Nightmare does... you fight things, and you kill them
Thu Oct 10 10:47:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:nightmare.imaginary.com 1701 on MudOS :)
Thu Oct 10 10:49:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as is NM
Thu Oct 10 10:49:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most new systems are skill based
Thu Oct 10 10:50:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Thu Oct 10 10:52:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM is undergoing a goblin raid at the moment though... might be a bit bloody
Thu Oct 10 12:41:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can create windows PF
Thu Oct 10 12:42:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dialogs require a frame to be attached to, but you can first open a frame
Thu Oct 10 12:59:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you end a while loop in an sh script?
Thu Oct 10 12:59:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:never mind
Thu Oct 10 13:27:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do I add in sh?
Thu Oct 10 13:29:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like $($count + 1)?
Thu Oct 10 13:30:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope
Thu Oct 10 13:30:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope
Thu Oct 10 13:31:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:echo the exact line?
Thu Oct 10 13:31:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, it is a bash thing
Thu Oct 10 13:33:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does 2>&1 means in redirection?
Thu Oct 10 13:34:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how to I redirect stderr to aa file? :)
Thu Oct 10 13:35:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Thu Oct 10 13:43:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, not at all
Thu Oct 10 13:43:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:static method in LPC mean you cannot do a call other on it
Thu Oct 10 13:44:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:static variable means it does not get saved by save object
Thu Oct 10 13:44:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the static keyword is one of my LPC pet peeves :)
Thu Oct 10 13:45:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:people need to now what level of MudOS LPC it is compat with
Thu Oct 10 13:46:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:nothing fails to work under it that works on v22b13
Thu Oct 10 13:47:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I want full compat with MudOS LPC :)
Thu Oct 10 13:48:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it should be
Thu Oct 10 13:50:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I do not control the mudos language )
Thu Oct 10 13:51:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:assuming you save your .o file
Thu Oct 10 13:52:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:in bash, how do I create a forever loop? while [???]; do
Thu Oct 10 13:58:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:as in \n
Thu Oct 10 13:58:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:?
Thu Oct 10 13:59:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:what does in the expression part?
Thu Oct 10 13:59:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I tried 1
Thu Oct 10 13:59:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:but it gives me bullshit about 1 command not found
Thu Oct 10 14:00:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I want the bash equivalent of while(1)
Thu Oct 10 14:01:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:thanks, got it
Thu Oct 10 14:02:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:any language that has hoops for doing integer additions sucksa :)
Thu Oct 10 14:02:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I do use perl for my scripting
Thu Oct 10 14:02:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:except for mud restart scripts
Thu Oct 10 14:02:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a script that uis pure command invocation is not too keen in perl
Thu Oct 10 14:09:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I appreciate your efforts... while[ 1 ] under bash errored forme
Thu Oct 10 14:10:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no... we lost a lot of files :(
Thu Oct 10 14:10:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Thu Oct 10 14:20:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:ahh, yes, a bug in convert_string()
Thu Oct 10 14:21:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Thu Oct 10 14:23:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you got it... I figured no one should ever load any objects
Thu Oct 10 14:30:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Beek is such an object
Thu Oct 10 21:45:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what about them?
Thu Oct 10 21:46:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you should be using either LIB_CLIENT or LIB_SERVER
Thu Oct 10 21:47:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Thu Oct 10 21:48:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:read_callback is a mudos efun and part of some very complex socket calls
Thu Oct 10 21:48:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you should be using either LIB_CLIEN or LIB-SERVER dependingon what you are doing
Thu Oct 10 21:48:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:which means you should not be claling mudos efuns
Thu Oct 10 21:49:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:more /lib/server.c and more /lib/client,c
Thu Oct 10 21:51:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:player->eventPrint(message)
Thu Oct 10 21:53:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Oct 10 21:53:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do not use message()
Thu Oct 10 21:53:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because messageis wrong
Thu Oct 10 21:54:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be in direct opposition o the README.txt doc that shipped with the lib
Thu Oct 10 21:55:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you are suposed to use eventPrint()
Thu Oct 10 21:55:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sure it is
Thu Oct 10 21:55:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib is designed around eventPrint()
Thu Oct 10 21:59:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, a couple of things
Thu Oct 10 22:00:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 you are making life massively hard on yourself by coding to the mudos sockets and not to the mudlib socket objects
Thu Oct 10 22:01:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 if you cannot figure out how to send a message to a player, I can't fathom how you would be able to manage mudos socket code
Thu Oct 10 22:01:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they work just fine... you probably are not handling the socket code right
Thu Oct 10 22:02:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning nothing is being sent to him
Thu Oct 10 22:02:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning you are getting nothing in a read_callback
Thu Oct 10 22:03:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:menaing your docket code is messedup
Thu Oct 10 22:03:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only what?
Thu Oct 10 22:03:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you do player->eventPrint(message), he player will see mssage
Thu Oct 10 22:04:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:therefore, message must be empty or not getting called
Thu Oct 10 22:05:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that would be wrong
Thu Oct 10 22:05:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in create(), this_player() could be anyone on earth
Thu Oct 10 22:06:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you do it wherever you know who it is you want to set player to
Thu Oct 10 22:06:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which could be just about anywhere
Thu Oct 10 22:07:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea
Thu Oct 10 22:07:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depends very much on what you are doing
Thu Oct 10 22:07:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and when you actually know something
Thu Oct 10 22:09:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Thu Oct 10 22:11:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Zapper
Thu Oct 10 22:11:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the shops sell items sold to them by players
Thu Oct 10 22:11:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it needs to have pointers to those object instances, not to a file name
Thu Oct 10 22:14:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what did you do to vndors?
Thu Oct 10 22:14:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 it will nver sell something for its value
Thu Oct 10 22:14:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 it has protections against negative values
Thu Oct 10 22:15:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should make up your own economy :)
Thu Oct 10 22:15:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:set your currencies however you like
Thu Oct 10 22:15:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:vendors stil wn't sell less than 0
Thu Oct 10 22:16:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:currency or economy, I forget
Thu Oct 10 22:23:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:skills averaes

Fri Oct 11 13:33:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the idea of reading through telnet RFC's turns my stomach :)
Fri Oct 11 13:37:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which one>
Fri Oct 11 13:42:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I would call that sun'sfault
Fri Oct 11 17:52:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:none, low, medium, high
Fri Oct 11 17:53:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as opposed to???
Fri Oct 11 17:53:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course not
Fri Oct 11 17:54:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know what the proper spelling is
Fri Oct 11 17:55:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make up the function names?
Fri Oct 11 17:56:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, first off, I spellcheck most function names that I don't know by heart
Fri Oct 11 17:56:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: the set() method is an incredibly stupid invention
Fri Oct 11 17:57:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, it is just odd to ask that Aristotle
Fri Oct 11 17:57:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I thought you were referring tothat versus FnbctionName()
Fri Oct 11 17:58:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because people make typos on this line all the time, why assume it is a misspelling oin the lib?
Fri Oct 11 17:59:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:almost every modern language uses mixed case
Fri Oct 11 17:59:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that was why it seemed odd to me... ratehr nit-picky
Fri Oct 11 18:00:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you think of it in _ terms?
Fri Oct 11 18:00:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should not get stupid error messages
Fri Oct 11 18:01:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since there is a very sane method to init caps
Fri Oct 11 18:02:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does not have cap name dirs
Fri Oct 11 18:02:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:excepting domain names
Fri Oct 11 18:03:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does not ship with mixed case file names
Fri Oct 11 18:03:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:except for documentation and domain dirs
Fri Oct 11 18:05:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:arguing about moix
Fri Oct 11 18:05:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mixed case is extremely stupid
Fri Oct 11 18:06:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mixed or not is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT, so long as whatever system is concsisytent
Fri Oct 11 18:06:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and NM is consistent
Fri Oct 11 18:06:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, because there is no suchj thing
Fri Oct 11 18:07:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the functionality of the system is INFINITELY more important
Fri Oct 11 18:07:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not
Fri Oct 11 18:07:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because some people will think one way, and others another
Fri Oct 11 18:07:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so it is a complete wash
Fri Oct 11 18:08:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yuck

Fri Oct 11 18:08:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:set-resistance is invalid
Fri Oct 11 18:10:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why ?
Fri Oct 11 18:10:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you stil use the shift keythe same amount, except you type an extra char
Fri Oct 11 18:11:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:2 x vs 1 x, + an extra char
Fri Oct 11 18:11:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so8unds like a wash
Fri Oct 11 18:13:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do what with resistance?
Fri Oct 11 18:13:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:method names should describe hat they do
Fri Oct 11 18:14:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sresistance and qresistance is dropping into the inane
Fri Oct 11 18:14:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is really dumb :)
Fri Oct 11 18:15:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually,m that is the perfect argument why the set() query() system is so horrid
Fri Oct 11 18:15:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Cre X asks, "Admin, why is set("resistence", x) no working?"
Fri Oct 11 18:15:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it compiles....
Fri Oct 11 18:16:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:spelling errors like that should be caught by the cmpilter
Fri Oct 11 18:16:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the compiler can't catch errors in string literals
Fri Oct 11 18:17:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeehaw
Fri Oct 11 18:17:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am too ashamed above being in this conversation to care
Fri Oct 11 18:18:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is a stupid damn conversation
Fri Oct 11 18:18:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't joke like that with me unless you know me
Fri Oct 11 18:19:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck you
Fri Oct 11 18:20:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't joke with people like that you do not know
Fri Oct 11 18:21:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can'tbelieve your parents are so ffucked up they did not tell you that
Fri Oct 11 18:21:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ver heard of common courtesy? manners?
Fri Oct 11 18:21:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am not joking with you, I am insulting you
Fri Oct 11 18:23:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a solid grip on reality, thanks
Fri Oct 11 18:23:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a degree in it, in fact
Fri Oct 11 18:23:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I dn't appreciate yahoos who don't know me joking with me on that level... it is rude, and I willc all you on iyt
Fri Oct 11 18:24:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry,m a degree from one of thebest schools in the nation
Fri Oct 11 18:24:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my typing always sucks
Fri Oct 11 18:24:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can't type on full size keyboards, and I am tying my shoes at the same time
Fri Oct 11 18:26:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle: #1 I was not referring to your comment, to someone else's
Fri Oct 11 18:26:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 like I said, I have a degree in the study of reality
Fri Oct 11 18:26:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like it or not
Fri Oct 11 18:26:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#3 looks like you could not take a CLUE from people using intercre to take this discussion here
Fri Oct 11 18:27:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks for judging my degree
Fri Oct 11 18:27:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, whatever
Fri Oct 11 18:28:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you know what metaphysics is?
Fri Oct 11 18:28:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Stealthy
Fri Oct 11 18:29:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I guess you don't know what metahysics is
Fri Oct 11 18:29:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wig yes Stealthy
Fri Oct 11 18:30:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:metaphysics is the study of reality
Fri Oct 11 18:30:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what my degree isin
Fri Oct 11 18:31:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that is not the way modern philosophy usesit
Fri Oct 11 18:32:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes you did
Fri Oct 11 18:32:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you said a degreein reality is bogus
Fri Oct 11 18:32:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I really am not concerned about its origin
Fri Oct 11 18:32:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the discussion is about my degree which you say is boogus
Fri Oct 11 18:33:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you admit you know jack about modern philosoy, yet you judge what I am saying aboutit as bogus?
Fri Oct 11 18:33:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how ignorant
Fri Oct 11 18:34:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't lecture me
Fri Oct 11 18:35:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mkdir /cmds/common /secure/cmds/common to fix the help problem
Fri Oct 11 18:35:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my ability to read language is not he problem
Fri Oct 11 18:35:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is your ability to make points relevant to the cnversation
Fri Oct 11 18:36:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:explain to me how the origina of the word metaphysics has anything to do with my degree?
Fri Oct 11 18:36:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ause that is the point you were making
Fri Oct 11 18:37:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that hasnothing to do with what it *is*
Fri Oct 11 18:37:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many words have the same meaning as 4000 years ago?
Fri Oct 11 18:38:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you still have not shown ou know what it is
Fri Oct 11 18:38:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no you don't
Fri Oct 11 18:38:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I understand ice cream but I havre no idea how it is made
Fri Oct 11 18:38:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know what i need to know to talk about it
Fri Oct 11 18:39:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you certanly have demonstrated no knowledge of modern metphysics
Fri Oct 11 18:39:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:duh
Fri Oct 11 18:39:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we were talking about my degree
Fri Oct 11 18:40:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:again, I don't see how aristotle's use of the word has anything to do with it
Fri Oct 11 18:41:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you have not addressed that
Fri Oct 11 18:41:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am still amazed Aristotle thinks he knpows my degree better than I
Fri Oct 11 18:41:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Myth, it isnot
Fri Oct 11 18:42:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange: I was talking about your explanation of your  degee
Fri Oct 11 18:42:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds liek you are questioning my understanding ofmy own degree
Fri Oct 11 18:42:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my explanation of it is my understanding of it
Fri Oct 11 18:43:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:see, you think you know my degree better than I
Fri Oct 11 18:43:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because that is exactly how I explain it
Fri Oct 11 18:43:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the study of reality
Fri Oct 11 18:44:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specifically, the study of reality with respect to reality
Fri Oct 11 18:44:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said the study of reality all along, or can't you read?
Fri Oct 11 18:44:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nMyth, physics studies reality through empiracal means, metaphysics through rational means
Fri Oct 11 18:45:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I said the study of reality, but that is not even meaningfully different
Fri Oct 11 18:45:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a degee is in the study of something
Fri Oct 11 18:46:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, it is not meaningfully different, and that is the only place I failed to use the word study (I think)
Fri Oct 11 18:46:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a degree is ALWAYS in the study of XXXX
Fri Oct 11 18:48:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: phjysics tool is empiracal evidence, that takes precedent over rational things
Fri Oct 11 18:49:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Blue: pxlain the diff between a degree in chemie and a degree in its study?
Fri Oct 11 18:49:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you cannot test and verify with empircal evidence in physics, you have nothing more than a theory
Fri Oct 11 18:50:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and not even a verifiable one
Fri Oct 11 18:50:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, so i have a vocational degree in relaity
Fri Oct 11 18:50:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks for clarifying that for me
Fri Oct 11 18:51:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can't fathom who would study studying checmistry
Fri Oct 11 18:51:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I aid, thanks SAristtole
Fri Oct 11 18:53:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud is not a fucking term paper
Fri Oct 11 18:53:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I think the distinction you are making is bogus
Fri Oct 11 18:54:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if you want to speak accurately, prima facie bogus does not mean bogus
Fri Oct 11 18:54:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and all along you have ben aying it is bogus
Fri Oct 11 18:54:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but now you say it is prima facie bogus
Fri Oct 11 18:54:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which isit?
Fri Oct 11 18:54:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:enquiring minds ant to know
Fri Oct 11 18:55:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, what I said was write
Fri Oct 11 18:55:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err right :)
Fri Oct 11 18:55:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whichis not boguis
Fri Oct 11 18:55:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and with respect to the cnversatin at hand, I do have a degreein reality
Fri Oct 11 18:56:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I stand by that statement
Fri Oct 11 18:56:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is nonsense
Fri Oct 11 18:56:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the ability of a work of art to convey empotion has nothing to do with its clarity
Fri Oct 11 18:57:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the degreeis on my shelf
Fri Oct 11 18:57:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never ride the bus
Fri Oct 11 18:59:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whiplash
Fri Oct 11 18:59:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said I don't ride the bus
Fri Oct 11 19:00:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that means I make more than everyone else how....
Fri Oct 11 19:00:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:FYI, it is a G20T, the second cheapest infiniti there is
Fri Oct 11 19:01:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never said you don't joke with strangers
Fri Oct 11 19:01:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said ou don't jokingly call strangrs ASSES
Fri Oct 11 19:01:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, I am sorry, you said I have not yet made an ass of myself as if I will
Fri Oct 11 19:02:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ou evidently do not understand the concept of implication
Fri Oct 11 19:02:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update /vrbs/common/help.c
Fri Oct 11 19:03:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zakk is not exactly on the list of people who agree with me randomly
Fri Oct 11 19:03:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chicekn butt
Fri Oct 11 19:04:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, Myth, basically
Fri Oct 11 19:04:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the definition of kissing my ass: agreeng with me
Fri Oct 11 19:05:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Fri Oct 11 19:05:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:metaphysics could give a damn about observed phenpomena
Fri Oct 11 19:06:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, metaphysics understands that our capacity to observe phenonemna is limited and ofetn wrong
Fri Oct 11 19:06:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shit, aristotle, you get your degree from watching Frazir?
Fri Oct 11 19:07:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Frazier: a televisio n show
Fri Oct 11 19:07:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what ever
Fri Oct 11 19:08:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think therefore I am :)
Fri Oct 11 19:08:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though there is a problem with the sunbject of that statement
Fri Oct 11 19:08:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:personally I take someone calling me an ass?
Fri Oct 11 19:08:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:odd thing that
Fri Oct 11 19:09:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: I actually woudl recommend reading some Descartes, it is a good place to get into understanding this, though he is cimpletely worng about everything
Fri Oct 11 19:10:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have not made a relevant point :)
Fri Oct 11 19:10:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are theonly one on a certain topic, you are not in the convrsation, now are you?
Fri Oct 11 19:11:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I do not sit on intercre and talk like I write
Fri Oct 11 19:11:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, let's see...
Fri Oct 11 19:11:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a degree in reality, so nanny nanny boo boo
Fri Oct 11 19:12:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: I am trying to think of a simple description
Fri Oct 11 19:12:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh shit, paradox
Fri Oct 11 19:12:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I've not said anything that was false
Fri Oct 11 19:14:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think someone being a fucknut is good evidence they are a moron
Fri Oct 11 19:14:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, hre is an example
Fri Oct 11 19:14:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:has to do actually with the subject of my thesis
Fri Oct 11 19:15:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do we know when an agent does something, and if so, what moral impleications does ithave
Fri Oct 11 19:15:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for the sake of argument, we assume there are actual beings in the world, and that some of them are rational
Fri Oct 11 19:16:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however, that is an assumption
Fri Oct 11 19:16:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we do not KNOW that there are any beings in reality, nor that any of them are rational
Fri Oct 11 19:16:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which of course is prima facie bogus
Fri Oct 11 19:16:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate...
Fri Oct 11 19:18:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the basic thing is first to ask the question, what is it to be an action ?
Fri Oct 11 19:18:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one which we would hold someone morally responsible for
Fri Oct 11 19:18:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example...
Fri Oct 11 19:18:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if a flip a light switch to turn on a light
Fri Oct 11 19:18:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but unknown to me, the switch is conencted to a bomb that destroys the earth
Fri Oct 11 19:18:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we would not consider that morally blameworthy
Fri Oct 11 19:19:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but if you knew the switch would blow up the earth, we would hold you morally respomnsible for that act
Fri Oct 11 19:19:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but both actions are physically the same act
Fri Oct 11 19:20:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are both flipping the light switch
Fri Oct 11 19:21:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too simplistic
Fri Oct 11 19:21:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you still have a problem with individuating events
Fri Oct 11 19:22:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you also have a problem with someone intending good, but doing bad, and should have known the act would do bad
Fri Oct 11 19:22:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so, the nxt thing to do is define what it is to be an event
Fri Oct 11 19:23:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:once you know what it is to be an event, you can identify how my amoral flipping of the switch is different from Zakk's malicious flipping of the switch
Fri Oct 11 19:23:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and something in the essence of that difference will help us determine what a moral act is, and what an immoral o an amoral act is
Fri Oct 11 19:24:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we think of acts as moral things
Fri Oct 11 19:24:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are good or bad based on hat you do
Fri Oct 11 19:24:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so it seems logical to look towards "those thigns we do" for moral content
Fri Oct 11 19:25:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are different actions
Fri Oct 11 19:26:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the point
Fri Oct 11 19:26:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we don't have a ay to individuate that event
Fri Oct 11 19:26:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: that is an illogical leap :)
Fri Oct 11 19:26:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are trying to define morality
Fri Oct 11 19:27:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we have the assumption that e judge some acts good and some ba
Fri Oct 11 19:27:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we are trying to get to an understanding of why, and what defines who is good and who isbad
Fri Oct 11 19:27:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you jumped all the way to a conclusion with nothign to support
Fri Oct 11 19:27:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which illustrates the original quesiton of udnerstanding mtaphysics
Fri Oct 11 19:28:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I nver stated they are objectively good or bad
Fri Oct 11 19:28:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: that is no metaphysics
Fri Oct 11 19:28:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you do not use common nnowledge or observed thigns to support a philosophical argument
Fri Oct 11 19:28:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Panther, you are jumping way ahead
Fri Oct 11 19:29:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only assumption is that we want to judge some acts good and some bad
Fri Oct 11 19:29:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: you wanted to udnerstand the philosophical process
Fri Oct 11 19:29:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is a power trip?
Fri Oct 11 19:30:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:philosophy likes to start from the fewest assumptions possible and use pure reason (not in kant's sense) to reach a conclusion
Fri Oct 11 19:31:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so, physics trying to say ou can't go faster than light is a power trip?
Fri Oct 11 19:31:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:me saying you should not kill Zakk is a power trip?
Fri Oct 11 19:31:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Panther, you are talking about things that arebeyond the point being discussed right now
Fri Oct 11 19:32:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:e have not gotten to that point in this discussion
Fri Oct 11 19:32:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Myth
Fri Oct 11 19:32:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all we have at this point is #1 there ae some being sin the world
Fri Oct 11 19:33:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 some of those beings at least are moral beings (meaning they factor into moral judgments)
Fri Oct 11 19:33:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:# moral judgments mean that at least some actions are considered good, and some bad
Fri Oct 11 19:34:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: philosophy does not care about observed phenomena
Fri Oct 11 19:34:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:our observations can mislead us
Fri Oct 11 19:34:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the three asumptions listed above are absolutely the only things we know going into an argument
Fri Oct 11 19:35:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I id not say our arguments are infallible
Fri Oct 11 19:35:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it matters what you assume
Fri Oct 11 19:35:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, if I quite soundly argue a certain point from those assumptions
Fri Oct 11 19:35:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you could dispute one of the assumptions
Fri Oct 11 19:35:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, you could say that no beings exist
Fri Oct 11 19:36:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:therefore there cannot be moral acts
Fri Oct 11 19:36:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, prove I exist
Fri Oct 11 19:36:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you want to start frm a point that is well proven
Fri Oct 11 19:37:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we need to know I exist before we can have a discussion about whether I ammoral
Fri Oct 11 19:37:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, prove that someone exists
Fri Oct 11 19:37:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, we can just assume to begin the argument
Fri Oct 11 19:38:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:later, if we deem it important, e can debate the asumptions
Fri Oct 11 19:39:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to a practical degree, yes, but smetimes philosophical arguments are made based onb ridiculous assumptions
Fri Oct 11 19:39:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the twin earth paradigm is a god exmaple of that
Fri Oct 11 19:39:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just the command name with no args
Fri Oct 11 19:40:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:twin earth, by the way, is assume there is an earth just like this one, except instead of X they have Y
Fri Oct 11 19:40:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:instead of horses, they have schmorses, etc. etc.
Fri Oct 11 19:41:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hanks :)
Fri Oct 11 19:42:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is here.... just not there... you know where you are
Fri Oct 11 19:42:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I assume
Fri Oct 11 19:43:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Myth: like i aid, philosophy does not care that its assumptions are necessariyl true, and it really does not care what observation tells us
Fri Oct 11 19:44:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a scientific methodology
Fri Oct 11 19:44:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not philosphically valid
Fri Oct 11 19:44:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Fri Oct 11 19:44:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am starting from a vry small core set of assumptions
Fri Oct 11 19:44:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't really care if they are necessarily true or proven
Fri Oct 11 19:45:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, the twin earth example is an xcellent xample of this
Fri Oct 11 19:45:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chinese room is another good example...
Fri Oct 11 19:46:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:philosophy will sometims quite intentionaly start with ridiculous assumptions
Fri Oct 11 19:46:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that do prove something
Fri Oct 11 19:46:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, philosophy does not deal in matter or anti-matter
Fri Oct 11 19:46:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:twin earth is an earth just like our earth,m except instead o horses, they have schmorses
Fri Oct 11 19:47:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and those schmorses behave very much like horses, except my twin calls them schmorses
Fri Oct 11 19:47:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course
Fri Oct 11 19:48:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to understand reality
Fri Oct 11 19:49:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you must be a physics prson :)
Fri Oct 11 19:49:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everything I have been talking about deals with reality
Fri Oct 11 19:49:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reality is not simple matter and particles and reactions
Fri Oct 11 19:50:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mtaphysics as a whole assumes our observations about thoses things can be completely rong
Fri Oct 11 19:50:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I could just be a brain in a vat and ou are all figments of my imagination
Fri Oct 11 19:51:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you know that Myth?
Fri Oct 11 19:51:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what Zac said
Fri Oct 11 19:51:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are elevant to Myth's question though
Fri Oct 11 19:53:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, first off, moralty
Fri Oct 11 19:53:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does physics tell us about good and evil?
Fri Oct 11 19:54:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does physics tell us about things we cannot observe?
Fri Oct 11 19:54:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I owuld argue impossible,m but go ahead :)
Fri Oct 11 19:55:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would prove nothing
Fri Oct 11 19:56:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:metaphysics is basedon rational evidence
Fri Oct 11 19:56:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would assume such a brain would come up with metaphysical ocncepts., or it would not be a brain
Fri Oct 11 19:56:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so what?
Fri Oct 11 19:56:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it proves what you assumed
Fri Oct 11 19:56:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that you have a simulated brain
Fri Oct 11 19:57:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not certain what that proves
Fri Oct 11 19:58:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it means your thought process can be replicated
Fri Oct 11 19:58:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have not shown subset
Fri Oct 11 19:58:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless ou want to agree that everything is a subset of psychology
Fri Oct 11 19:58:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since brains think of everything
Fri Oct 11 19:58:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one said anything aboutthehuman mind
Fri Oct 11 19:59:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he said it could be replicated
Fri Oct 11 19:59:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hich assumes that brains are piurely physical and thus cannot be used to argue that brains are purely physical
Fri Oct 11 19:59:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it can be replicated then it can be replicated is your argument
Fri Oct 11 19:59:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at least as I have heard it
Fri Oct 11 20:00:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I said simply that physics does not address unobserved phenomena
Fri Oct 11 20:00:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it could be god, the osul, synchronicity, whatever
Fri Oct 11 20:00:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not address morality
Fri Oct 11 20:01:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not address the issue of how we know what we know
Fri Oct 11 20:01:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am saying so what
Fri Oct 11 20:01:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we have not even ruled out the existence of a soul by that
Fri Oct 11 20:01:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reductio as absudum: everything is psychology
Fri Oct 11 20:02:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ad
Fri Oct 11 20:03:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why is it that this created physical mind cannot have a non-created componenet?
Fri Oct 11 20:03:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:after all, ourbrains are createdby purely physical processes
Fri Oct 11 20:04:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is a silly inter-disciplinary argument anyways
Fri Oct 11 20:04:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who takes precendet
Fri Oct 11 20:04:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would prove nothing
Fri Oct 11 20:04:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just created a simulated brain
Fri Oct 11 20:04:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/lib/npc.c
Fri Oct 11 20:05:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it cannot do metaphysical theories
Fri Oct 11 20:05:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:therefore, there are non-physicla things
Fri Oct 11 20:05:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/lib/sentient models the mind
Fri Oct 11 20:06:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you detrmine when your model is sufficiently good enough?
Fri Oct 11 20:07:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if we did create such a thing, it would suggest nothing about the precedence of one over the other
Fri Oct 11 20:07:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are assuming that physial models could thus be used to replicate rational thought
Fri Oct 11 20:07:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I could turn around and doubt you exist
Fri Oct 11 20:08:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so there :)
Fri Oct 11 20:08:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do ou do when a physical model doubts itself?
Fri Oct 11 20:09:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:philosophy does nto suggest physics is invalid
Fri Oct 11 20:09:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it just studies reality iusing different tools
Fri Oct 11 20:09:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:same with religion
Fri Oct 11 20:10:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and smehow, i feel that is at the heart of this argument... the physicist thinking the philosopher is saying what he does is nonsense :)
Fri Oct 11 20:58:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:oyu need to type update /verbs/common/help.c
Fri Oct 11 20:58:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, then the he,lp will be there if the class eixsts
Fri Oct 11 20:59:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you failed to add it
Fri Oct 11 21:00:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then probably you did not do the class name in the class file right
Fri Oct 11 21:03:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, should be lwer czase for race name
Fri Oct 11 21:04:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it probably should nnot be case sensitive
Fri Oct 11 21:10:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does it say class added when you do addclass?
Fri Oct 11 21:11:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do call /daemon/classes->GetClasses()
Fri Oct 11 21:13:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the classes are stored as keys to mappings, so they cannot be identical ones listed multiple times, there must be something about the strings
Fri Oct 11 21:15:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define not working?
Fri Oct 11 21:16:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then update he help command
Fri Oct 11 21:17:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define didn;t work
Fri Oct 11 21:18:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call /daemon/classes->GetHelp("monk")
Fri Oct 11 21:21:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you did not add the class
Fri Oct 11 21:23:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it cannot be in /dameon/classes if you get 0 form GetHelp()
Fri Oct 11 21:23:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my guess is your class names in the class file does not match the file name in which they are located
Fri Oct 11 21:27:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the help daemon knos what classes exist by calling classes->GetHelp()
Fri Oct 11 21:28:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:if, after you update /verbs/common/help.c
Fri Oct 11 21:28:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it does not list the racesin help, it means the classes daemon does not think they exist
Fri Oct 11 21:29:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Nightmare.tar.gz
Fri Oct 11 21:31:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, what have you changed?
Fri Oct 11 21:33:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:then you need to step through the class code and see what is happening
Fri Oct 11 21:33:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:because as it comes with the lib, it works
Fri Oct 11 21:34:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:does not mean there are odd unforeseen things you can do to screw it up... but it does mean the stuff that comes with the lib works
Fri Oct 11 21:37:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Fri Oct 11 21:37:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that would create a paradox :)
Fri Oct 11 21:37:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or a catch 22
Fri Oct 11 21:54:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no problem
Fri Oct 11 21:56:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no
Fri Oct 11 21:56:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no need to inherit after defining them
Fri Oct 11 21:58:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yep, that is why it is called a COMPAT BUSTER :)

Sat Oct 12 11:50:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that would almost certainly be a very cool security leak
Sat Oct 12 11:51:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:let's see, I pass you (: rm, "/lib/player.c" :) and rebind it to you
Sat Oct 12 11:52:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you should not create functions in objects which will be destructed

Sat Oct 12 11:59:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the player object should know what functions it is calling

Sat Oct 12 12:40:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, the dude speaking bad german earlier
Sat Oct 12 12:42:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it would not be so bad if he actually knew how to speak the language

Sat Oct 12 21:37:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is not a thing in tell_object() that can be done that cannot be done with eventPrint()
Sat Oct 12 21:37:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depends
Sat Oct 12 21:38:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, have you looked at eventPrint()
Sat Oct 12 21:39:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eventPrint() does not format anything you don't want it toformat
Sat Oct 12 21:39:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as a side note, Hicup's telnet client does not use LIB_CLIENT and thus is a bad NM socket implementation
Sat Oct 12 21:40:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Sat Oct 12 21:40:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is bad inside a mudlib that encapsulates socket efuns
Sat Oct 12 21:41:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when you work with a clss library, you are supposed to code wtihin that framework
Sat Oct 12 21:41:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:portable is not necessarily a good thing
Sat Oct 12 21:42:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are trying to write something that fits within the class library you are using, that is bad
Sat Oct 12 21:43:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so, now mudos COMPAT BUSTERs to socket efuns need to be duplicated
Sat Oct 12 21:46:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is bad coding
Sat Oct 12 21:46:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:esp[ecially in an object-oriented team project like a mud
Sat Oct 12 21:47:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, it is rather difficult
Sat Oct 12 21:48:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos sockets suck
Sat Oct 12 21:48:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sinc always
Sat Oct 12 21:49:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where else in LPC do ou have to buffer input and output and worry about I/O callbacks?
Sat Oct 12 21:50:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, then you have not talked to a lot of people who have used them
Sat Oct 12 21:50:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you already understand a bit about I/O, specifically about TCP/IP sockets
Sat Oct 12 21:51:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:almost no mud admins do
Sat Oct 12 21:51:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they wamnt to call socket->write() and see it get whereit needs to go
Sat Oct 12 21:52:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:furthermore, there is no reason on earth to have to do anything other than socket->write()
Sat Oct 12 21:53:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, but I din't
Sat Oct 12 21:53:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I inhrited LIB_CLIENT
Sat Oct 12 21:54:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LIB_CLIENT encapsulates mudos socket code
Sat Oct 12 21:55:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, I am not aying socket code is hard forme
Sat Oct 12 21:55:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I am a professional programmer who specializes internet profgramming
Sat Oct 12 21:56:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Oct 12 21:57:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos sockets are a hell of a lot like winsock sockets
Sat Oct 12 21:58:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most thigns in mudos change
Sat Oct 12 21:58:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that is not even the point
Sat Oct 12 21:58:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:th epoint is that when you are using a class library, you stick within its framework
Sat Oct 12 21:59:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you donot redo solutins, because that always leads to headaches down the road
Sat Oct 12 22:03:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep, but portable among MudOS implementations is probably a bad thing
Sat Oct 12 22:03:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in my experience it generally is
Sat Oct 12 22:04:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, reinventing the wehll in an OO, team project is ALWAYS bad
Sat Oct 12 22:04:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it is very poor programming practice
Sat Oct 12 22:07:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reinventing the wheel can sometimes tell you a lot about tchnial issues, but in an environment like a mud, it is a bad habit and one that outweighs any good
Sat Oct 12 22:07:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one written for NM wouldbe much better for NM muds
Sat Oct 12 22:08:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though I think an LPC ftp daemon is bad on general principles
Sat Oct 12 22:10:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, no
Sat Oct 12 22:10:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means your playr's get their combat held up by someone transfring master.c
Sat Oct 12 22:10:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:c'est   moi
Sat Oct 12 22:12:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a vry bizarre set of circumatcnes to build an otherwise bad system around :)
Sat Oct 12 22:16:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what an external ftp dameon is for
Sat Oct 12 22:18:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bcause your master object is used to make your toast?
Sat Oct 12 22:20:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bug fixes
Sat Oct 12 22:20:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, that is what Zakk said exactly
Sat Oct 12 22:21:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:come on Zakk, you know you suggested allowing any random player reboot the mud
Sat Oct 12 22:25:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I have no idea what that means
Sat Oct 12 22:29:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he version that coems with IVr4 does that
Sat Oct 12 23:40:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because of an error on the HB code
Sat Oct 12 23:41:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the difference between blowing and erroring?
Sat Oct 12 23:42:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right, Claire, an error
Sat Oct 12 23:42:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea Stealthie :)
Sat Oct 12 23:43:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea, I don't sue that stuff
Sat Oct 12 23:44:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Sat Oct 12 23:44:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what isbetter about it?
Sat Oct 12 23:45:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every type is very incompatible with others
Sat Oct 12 23:45:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:compatibility is not a good thing
Sat Oct 12 23:45:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless you want a mud that does nothing
Sat Oct 12 23:45:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Sat Oct 12 23:45:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really :)
Sat Oct 12 23:46:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos just happens to have a 3.2.1 emulation mode
Sat Oct 12 23:46:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really
Sat Oct 12 23:46:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not my mudos
Sat Oct 12 23:46:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't have UID's
Sat Oct 12 23:46:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, nuff said there
Sat Oct 12 23:46:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Foundation does not support UID's
Sat Oct 12 23:47:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, MudOS has a 3.2.1 emulation mode
Sat Oct 12 23:47:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means 3.2.1 code can be taken to it
Sat Oct 12 23:47:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that is so completely unimportant
Sat Oct 12 23:47:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the question is how well does MudOS help you build a mud
Sat Oct 12 23:48:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and IMHO, it does it better than 3.2.1 from what little Iknow of 3.2.1
Sat Oct 12 23:48:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you have yet to suggest smething cool about 3.2.1 which would make me change my mind
Sat Oct 12 23:48:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is slower
Sat Oct 12 23:48:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was faster in 1994
Sat Oct 12 23:49:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sat Oct 12 23:49:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bases?
Sat Oct 12 23:49:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you compile them in, yes
Sat Oct 12 23:49:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you leave them out, no
Sat Oct 12 23:50:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:amylaar is certainlymuch more bloated in that respect :)
Sat Oct 12 23:50:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so that nbew features are forced into the package as a whole
Sat Oct 12 23:50:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it is very difficult to separate features you donot want
Sat Oct 12 23:51:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos allows you to compile in the features you want, and compile out those you do not want
Sat Oct 12 23:51:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what features do you want to compileoutof mudos?
Sat Oct 12 23:51:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then how can you claim it has to many features?
Sat Oct 12 23:52:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it comes with a configuration file
Sat Oct 12 23:52:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you have so far heard a lot that is wrong
Sat Oct 12 23:52:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos has more features and is faster
Sat Oct 12 23:52:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and those features are integrated in such a way that you compile in the features oyu want and leaveoutthose you do not wnat
Sat Oct 12 23:53:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the base of what is required for mudos is *mudch* smaller than what is required for amylaar
Sat Oct 12 23:54:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no player'spoint of view of a driver
Sun Oct 13 09:35:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call_out_info
Sun Oct 13 16:57:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:file does not exist, empty file, or whatever
Sun Oct 13 16:58:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:everything has prmission to read that dir, unless you restricted it
Sun Oct 13 17:01:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for read perms?
Sun Oct 13 17:01:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not writing to the file
Sun Oct 13 17:01:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means everyone can read it
Sun Oct 13 17:02:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means either the file is empty of the mud itself has no permission to read it from the OS
Sun Oct 13 17:04:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Oct 13 17:04:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what would be an adjective describing an item's ability to defy gavity?
Sun Oct 13 17:04:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is for a Get*() method
Sun Oct 13 17:06:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Oct 13 17:06:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe.... that probably is the best answer I have heard :)
Sun Oct 13 17:07:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:GetLift() is better...
Sun Oct 13 17:09:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Oct 13 17:09:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, no
Sun Oct 13 17:09:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everything can read it
Sun Oct 13 17:09:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the file is either empty or the mud cannot read it
Sun Oct 13 20:18:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Spctre: yes
Sun Oct 13 20:18:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:encre
Sun Oct 13 20:19:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I believe the eb page says so
Sun Oct 13 20:34:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in theory, it may have broken with parser changes
Sun Oct 13 20:34:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that may not work preoperly until I release IVr5
Sun Oct 13 20:38:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:contrary to what I stated, I have added a ton of new features for the next release
Sun Oct 13 20:45:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr5 will be later this week
Sun Oct 13 20:46:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sun Oct 13 21:06:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Sun Oct 13 21:06:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no such thing as room specific verbs
Sun Oct 13 23:07:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, that is a bug in smell.c that is fixed for the nxt release
Sun Oct 13 23:08:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr5
Sun Oct 13 23:09:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is working perfectly fine here
Sun Oct 13 23:32:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:post
Sun Oct 13 23:37:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM IV blos 3 away
Sun Oct 13 23:39:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that is a mail thing
Sun Oct 13 23:39:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:post is the command to post to a bboard
Sun Oct 13 23:41:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no post.c command
Sun Oct 13 23:41:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is an antiquated add-action(), needs replacing
Sun Oct 13 23:42:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea, i don't know what your problem is
Mon Oct 14 08:58:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Claire, are you reallu stupid?
Mon Oct 14 16:33:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any 32 MB 72 pin chips with parity they need to iunload?
Mon Oct 14 16:34:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, wel, shut the fuck up Saint
Mon Oct 14 16:36:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:48 MB
Mon Oct 14 16:36:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:104 MB
Mon Oct 14 16:37:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when you are on the same machine as Discworld, youneed all the RAM you can get :)
Mon Oct 14 16:42:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gosh, that makes it bettr Saint
Mon Oct 14 17:06:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you need sprintf() to handle colours?
Mon Oct 14 17:06:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:terminal_colour() does wrapping these days :)
Mon Oct 14 17:08:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the declaration is varargs string sprintf(mixed array args...)
Mon Oct 14 17:15:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:efun::sprintf(args...)
Mon Oct 14 17:16:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:declare it with as much info as can be known to be required
Mon Oct 14 20:05:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't
Mon Oct 14 20:05:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ob->is_living()
Mon Oct 14 20:08:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is the eval command
Mon Oct 14 20:10:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks for the uninformed commentary Plop
Mon Oct 14 20:10:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Willy: that's it
Mon Oct 14 20:10:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to play around with verbs for now, it is very new
Mon Oct 14 20:13:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, see, not allowing a second char is not even a mudlib thing
Mon Oct 14 20:13:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a Nightmare LPMud policy
Mon Oct 14 20:13:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which shows how ignorant Plop is
Mon Oct 14 20:14:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cres on muds that have bodies are generaly poor test chars since their skills are so way out of whack with reality
Mon Oct 14 20:16:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not like you are hurting my feelings by saying you like one of my libs better than another
Mon Oct 14 20:17:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but anyone who thinks NM 3 even holds a candle to NM IV has a very poor capacity for judging sound systems design
Mon Oct 14 20:17:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with respect to either NM IV or Lima, NM 3 sucks
Mon Oct 14 20:18:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was good for the time period in which it was created, but life has moved on
Mon Oct 14 20:20:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Zfnab, I think he right... I am living in a mirror universe
Mon Oct 14 20:20:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and today is opposite day
Mon Oct 14 20:21:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop and more people play NM 4 because it is better than it was with 3
Mon Oct 14 20:21:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm this should be here
Mon Oct 14 20:21:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did NM 3 have flying? no
Mon Oct 14 20:21:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did NM 3 have the parser? no
Mon Oct 14 20:22:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did NM 3 have support for anything sueful NM 4 does not? no
Mon Oct 14 20:22:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a mudos bug, ignoreit
Mon Oct 14 20:23:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct 14 20:23:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop, please name one thing...
Mon Oct 14 20:23:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct 14 20:24:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the stuff about no cre bodies?  that is all hogwash
Mon Oct 14 20:24:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the stuff about not letting cres login at the same time as a second char?  that prevents cheating
Mon Oct 14 20:25:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know of no mud that allos that
Mon Oct 14 20:25:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Copper: it happens with all driversof that version
Mon Oct 14 20:25:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not just NM
Mon Oct 14 20:27:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no second char lkogins for wizzes is almost univrsal
Mon Oct 14 20:27:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was not allowed on NM 3
Mon Oct 14 20:28:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM wizzes whoever wants to wiz because requiring people to make level 20 is stupid
Mon Oct 14 20:28:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:guess what Plop: it is not a mudlib thing
Mon Oct 14 20:29:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you understand that>?
Mon Oct 14 20:29:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the one character/time limit is a NIGHTMARE MUD rule, nothing to do with the mudlib
Mon Oct 14 20:29:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:despair: this isnothing about test chars
Mon Oct 14 20:29:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop is being a rude twerp and talking on intercre
Mon Oct 14 20:30:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intercrre == code line
Mon Oct 14 20:32:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop: you still have not shown the brainpower to understand the difference between NM mud and NM mudlib
Mon Oct 14 20:32:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM Mud, using NM 3 and using NM 4, has the rule that a creator cannot login at the same time as their active player character
Mon Oct 14 20:33:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that had nothing to do with which version of NM wasbeing used
Mon Oct 14 20:33:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:other people using the mudlib, either 3 or 4, are free to have such a rule or not, neither 3 or 4 forces you to have such a piolicy
Mon Oct 14 20:34:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM mud allows cres to have as many test chars loggedin at the same time as is necessary for testing
Mon Oct 14 20:34:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so please explain what there is problematic?
Mon Oct 14 20:34:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can't just add a new field
Mon Oct 14 20:35:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ALTER TABLE  might be what you want, if you have the right DBMS
Mon Oct 14 20:35:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop: ou did not answer my point
Mon Oct 14 20:35:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ALTER TABLE does not work for all DBMS in all situations
Mon Oct 14 20:37:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop: that was not NM LPMud
Mon Oct 14 20:37:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or that story is a complete lie
Mon Oct 14 20:41:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt anyone here is upset
Mon Oct 14 20:41:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably amused is the best way to characterize it
Mon Oct 14 20:42:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop: you have not addressed one valid point any person has made
Mon Oct 14 20:42:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:instead, you have simply made ignorant statements and lies
Mon Oct 14 20:42:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:potty joke? what potty joke?
Mon Oct 14 20:44:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Plop: one more time: what is better anbout NM 3 than 4?
Mon Oct 14 20:44:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so far, your second char stuff is completely untrue and the wiz body thing is just a preference thing that is easily changeable
Mon Oct 14 20:44:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:his daddy obviously did not beat him enough
Mon Oct 14 20:45:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cres differ from players only by what you inherit
Mon Oct 14 20:46:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let's assume, however, it is hard as hell
Mon Oct 14 20:46:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is so bad about cres not having bodies?
Mon Oct 14 20:47:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have not said once what is the problem
Mon Oct 14 20:47:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all you have said is that the entire NM 3 system is infinitely better because of this one feature
Mon Oct 14 20:47:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I am asking you to define what is so important baout this one feature that makes it the defining element
Mon Oct 14 20:48:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt he knows what the parser is
Mon Oct 14 20:50:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no order
Mon Oct 14 20:51:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean, you selected a single row, and you want to display the next?
Mon Oct 14 20:53:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using SQL? you can't... there is no order to a table
Mon Oct 14 20:54:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what mudlib?
Mon Oct 14 20:55:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which who
Mon Oct 14 20:55:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, type which who
Mon Oct 14 21:02:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:test
Mon Oct 14 21:28:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:why would you get to level if you are not good at what you are?
Mon Oct 14 21:32:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:NM mudlib does not release its spells because we do not want a bunch of NM muds out there
Mon Oct 14 21:32:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there are several systems NM does not release to the public
Mon Oct 14 22:14:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:c ya
Mon Oct 14 22:19:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean?
Mon Oct 14 22:20:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to make up skills that are relevant to the mud you build
Mon Oct 14 22:21:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:petty much whatever fighters have
Mon Oct 14 22:21:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the only skills the basic lib uses are the combat skills
Mon Oct 14 22:25:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:snow!
Mon Oct 14 22:26:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:in northern MN
Mon Oct 14 22:44:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is new year on all NM muds :)
Mon Oct 14 22:45:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I guess Zakk is my true love
Mon Oct 14 23:05:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ask the question a different way... what isnot working
Mon Oct 14 23:06:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt it
Mon Oct 14 23:07:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what objs?
Mon Oct 14 23:08:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most of the mudlib uses the parser
Mon Oct 14 23:08:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so it is being used
Mon Oct 14 23:09:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you gained what by doing that?
Mon Oct 14 23:09:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean a mud with no players would not crash
Mon Oct 14 23:11:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not my assessment of the right thing to do
Mon Oct 14 23:13:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wouldn't it make more sense to get a handle on the parser and do it right :)
Tue Oct 15 00:34:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no idea, bill gates did that change
Tue Oct 15 00:38:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I have no idea
Tue Oct 15 00:39:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt GetName(), probably GetKeyName() and  I point you to the showtree command :)
Tue Oct 15 00:57:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no it represents the first argument passed to a functional
Tue Oct 15 09:14:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Dead Souls
Tue Oct 15 09:16:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:another what mud?
Tue Oct 15 18:53:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:don't know terminal type when welcome is displayed
Tue Oct 15 18:56:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:certainly borrowing the colour codes from NM or IE is fine
Tue Oct 15 18:57:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:count each check
Tue Oct 15 18:57:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and at the 20th try without it happening, make it happen
Tue Oct 15 18:57:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Oct 15 18:58:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean do a random(100) + 1 < 6
Tue Oct 15 18:58:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but check every time you do the random check
Tue Oct 15 18:58:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if you make it to the 20th time, force it to happen without the random check
Tue Oct 15 19:01:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only the code would be copyright
Tue Oct 15 19:01:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless it is an extremely proprietary terminal system
Tue Oct 15 19:03:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:random algorithms are not mudlib based
Tue Oct 15 19:03:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it deend son your OS
Tue Oct 15 19:20:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:figures from the past stand tall, and mocking voices ring the hall
Tue Oct 15 19:23:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is just set to Ylsrim
Tue Oct 15 19:23:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you are supposed to give the concept meaning on your own
Tue Oct 15 19:24:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not an important point :)
Tue Oct 15 19:26:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some driver thing that has no bearing on anything working
Tue Oct 15 19:38:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:players don't know jack about directories
Tue Oct 15 20:20:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:technically yes, but not in the way you mean
Tue Oct 15 20:22:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:virtual rooms, and 99% of the people who do them, including myself, do them wrong
Tue Oct 15 20:23:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update
Tue Oct 15 20:25:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:[]?
Tue Oct 15 20:55:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, but who really cares if it does?
Tue Oct 15 20:56:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what would you expect an encre command to do with Foundation?
Tue Oct 15 20:57:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no I don't know :)
Tue Oct 15 20:57:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that doc probably has some stuff init for NM only that should not be in Foundation... encre would be oneof those
Tue Oct 15 20:58:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, there are no playrs onb Foundation
Tue Oct 15 20:58:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thus encre has no purpose :)
Tue Oct 15 21:53:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I thought Plop was an expert on the differences between 3 and 4
Tue Oct 15 21:53:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have not found many?????
Tue Oct 15 21:54:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or just type mudlib mudname
Tue Oct 15 21:54:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:junk?
Tue Oct 15 21:55:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is nothing about 3.2.2 that is better than IV
Tue Oct 15 21:56:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you like baout add_action()?
Tue Oct 15 21:56:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:add_action() isan extremely lame invention
Tue Oct 15 21:57:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hello
Tue Oct 15 21:59:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does that mean mine is hard to understand?
Tue Oct 15 22:03:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, for a generic LPC textbook, that would not necessarily be a good thing
Tue Oct 15 22:03:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because there are 4 major dialects of LPC
Tue Oct 15 22:03:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also, given that a largenumber of people coding LPC now learned from my documents, I doubt they are as hard as you say
Tue Oct 15 22:03:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your mudlib should provide you with detailed examples of how to buildon your mud
Tue Oct 15 22:04:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:examples of Lima code would confuse NM develpoeprs, and vice versa
Tue Oct 15 22:06:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is 	quite a big claim coming out and stating your work is definitively better than the existing major work out there
Tue Oct 15 22:07:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know it culd be better :)
Tue Oct 15 22:07:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it could be a lot btter
Tue Oct 15 22:08:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i just find it interesting that someone would step out and declare their work better
Tue Oct 15 22:08:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with no body of actual developer experience outthere to back up the claim
Tue Oct 15 22:08:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and how many drivers has Legion had experience with?
Tue Oct 15 22:08:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many mudlibs? :)
Tue Oct 15 22:09:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in depth? or looked at them?
Tue Oct 15 22:10:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I guess I will have to take your word for it :)
Tue Oct 15 22:11:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPMud 2.4.5, LPMud 3.1.2, DGD, and MudOS
Tue Oct 15 22:20:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no orc race
Tue Oct 15 22:26:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means you have no human race
Tue Oct 15 22:29:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you probably hosed your races since you last loaded the working balrog
Tue Oct 15 22:29:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or you are talking about a totally unrelated problem
Tue Oct 15 22:29:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:having a race file does not make once exist
Tue Oct 15 22:30:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the powers that be
Tue Oct 15 22:31:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not the error I am referring to... it is your lack of knowledge of the race system around which the error centers
Tue Oct 15 22:32:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specifically, the error you mention results from trying to set a race that doesnot exist
Tue Oct 15 22:32:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thus you need to look at why the SetRace() method thinks one does not exist
Tue Oct 15 22:33:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I recommend not starting a mud
Tue Oct 15 22:33:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and working on building one with someone else
Tue Oct 15 22:33:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are too many muds right now
Tue Oct 15 22:34:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it diminishes the quality of other muds
Tue Oct 15 22:34:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if everyone is an admin, then there are no cres
Tue Oct 15 22:34:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially when people who have never coded a thing before try STARTING a mud
Tue Oct 15 22:36:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:now every yahoo with a PPP link wants to run a mud :)
Tue Oct 15 22:36:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you learn more faster if ou code areas on a mud, and at he same time you contribute more to others
Tue Oct 15 22:36:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nonsense R'aaza, it forces it down
Tue Oct 15 22:36:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many areas you coded R'aaza?
Tue Oct 15 22:38:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people turn out shit left and right...
Tue Oct 15 22:38:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hoe many muds on I3 right now actually have players?
Tue Oct 15 22:39:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare, Discworld, nanvaent, StarMud, Archon... anyone else?
Tue Oct 15 22:40:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what a contribution
Tue Oct 15 22:40:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and contribute nothing
Tue Oct 15 22:41:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Vashkar: I am not suggesting you should not be running your own mud
Tue Oct 15 22:41:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:R'aaza, why do you want to run before you can walk?
Tue Oct 15 22:42:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was specifically directed at R'aaza
Tue Oct 15 22:42:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what have you coded n the mud world to date?nothing
Tue Oct 15 22:42:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not walking before runningf
Tue Oct 15 22:42:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what? where?
Tue Oct 15 22:43:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would be extremely surprised if that mud actually had players on it in 1 year
Tue Oct 15 22:44:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:graylind? I have never even heard of that
Tue Oct 15 22:44:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM player base is growing and doing well, thanks :)
Tue Oct 15 22:45:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, like I said, I will be extremely suprise if it has any longevity to i t at all
Tue Oct 15 22:46:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I could give a shit if anyone uses my stuff
Tue Oct 15 22:46:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:other's hopes? I know how many muds actually open and stay open
Tue Oct 15 22:47:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I also know that these days no one wanbts to be a creator
Tue Oct 15 22:47:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone wants to be an admin
Tue Oct 15 22:47:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and so NM creatoes piss me off more than most
Tue Oct 15 22:47:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because they come onto NM and look around, and then leave and take the lib I built in some perverse attempt to put NM down
Tue Oct 15 22:51:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is muds like Destinay that inspire me to to release any of the cool features NM is developing to the world in general
Tue Oct 15 22:52:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Paul: that is a very LPMud-specific question
Tue Oct 15 22:53:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like as in Amylaar specific
Tue Oct 15 22:53:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not internally
Tue Oct 15 22:54:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is only heart_beat and call_out
Tue Oct 15 22:58:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is impossible thank god :)
Tue Oct 15 23:01:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:really... just THINK what a wait() would mean
Tue Oct 15 23:02:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the whole mud waits while your wait() sits quietly
Tue Oct 15 23:03:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not what call out does
Wed Oct 16 00:05:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is the net there?
Wed Oct 16 00:38:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what ya need?
Wed Oct 16 00:40:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:looks like that is not the line it is looking at
Wed Oct 16 00:40:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or more likely, you have an extra "" somewhere n there
Wed Oct 16 00:42:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Oct 16 00:44:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no :) I told you., you hjave an extra " somewhere
Wed Oct 16 00:47:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for some reason, the compiler thinks you are passing one arg to SetDoor()
Wed Oct 16 00:49:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know, it is your file
Wed Oct 16 00:49:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Oct 16 00:52:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the , before ]) willnot make a difference
Wed Oct 16 00:52:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:next step is to comment out the SetDoor(0 line and see if the room compiles
Wed Oct 16 00:52:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it compiles, the error is in the SetDoor(0- line, if it doesnot, it is elsewhere
Wed Oct 16 09:25:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:decided to sit and lie about me while I am not on R'aaza?
Wed Oct 16 09:26:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I guess so, seems he is not here now though...
Wed Oct 16 10:12:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Admins

Wed Oct 16 10:13:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mkdir /cmds/common /secure/cmds/common
Wed Oct 16 10:13:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then update /verbs/common/help.c
Wed Oct 16 10:14:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:talk to R'aaza
Wed Oct 16 10:15:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that mant create two dirs
Wed Oct 16 10:15:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/cmds/common and /secure/cmds/common
Wed Oct 16 10:16:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Krem I think his actiuons speak for your entire yet another pathetic attempt at duplicating NM the way it should be(TM) mud
Wed Oct 16 10:17:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:congradulations
Wed Oct 16 10:17:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no problem Old One
Wed Oct 16 10:17:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:please do have a look at that web page though
Wed Oct 16 10:21:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/realms?
Wed Oct 16 10:23:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:questions in the README doc and getting started doc are dumb :)
Wed Oct 16 10:24:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/doc/mudlib
Wed Oct 16 10:24:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I believe the doc is called MudLocking or something
Wed Oct 16 10:25:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the getting started doc is on that web page
Wed Oct 16 10:25:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the win32 mudos isnot at all stripped down
Wed Oct 16 10:25:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the same drivr and same mudlib
Wed Oct 16 12:09:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what a clever boy you are Emkil to come up with such a witty comment
Wed Oct 16 16:01:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:economy
Wed Oct 16 16:02:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is really quite simple :)
Wed Oct 16 16:04:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, that is the way to do it for a test char
Wed Oct 16 21:07:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just what it says :)
Wed Oct 16 21:12:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:decided to move on to somethign else Tim?
Wed Oct 16 21:14:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am thinking maybe I all I am doing with NM is let twits open half-based muds that deplete the number of players playign real muds
Wed Oct 16 21:22:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dole is a gezer
Wed Oct 16 21:42:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM is at 19 right now :)
Wed Oct 16 21:46:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just code a ne wone... what info you looking for specifically?
Wed Oct 16 21:47:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to update all the LPC files
Wed Oct 16 21:47:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when in doubt, reboot :)
Wed Oct 16 22:40:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that is something to be proud of
Wed Oct 16 23:04:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Oct 16 23:05:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your food vendor
Wed Oct 16 23:07:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are a lot of factors that matter... bargaining of player and vendor, currency rates, etc
Wed Oct 16 23:09:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then muck with the barkeep sell formula :)
Wed Oct 16 23:13:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes
Wed Oct 16 23:21:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just can't plug in the old race.c
Wed Oct 16 23:22:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, in the current version, all races... it will show only player racesnext release
Thu Oct 17 00:17:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes it does
Thu Oct 17 00:17:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cost and value are two different things
Thu Oct 17 00:17:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cost is how much I have to pay for it, value is how much the vemndor will give me
Thu Oct 17 00:26:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:GetValue() is simply a currency-neutral value
Thu Oct 17 00:26:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is independent of whether the item is being bought or sold
Thu Oct 17 00:26:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is its core vale
Thu Oct 17 00:27:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the vendor then uses that information to determine how much he wisshes to pay for it or sell it for
Thu Oct 17 00:29:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with food, the system uses the food strength to calculate value
Thu Oct 17 00:29:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is based on experience on LPMuds
Thu Oct 17 00:29:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where one cre sets a cup of coffee to 60 gold, and another 5 gold
Thu Oct 17 00:30:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is to take out the bizarre relativity of pricing which occurs with food on lpmuds
Thu Oct 17 00:30:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so in food, Setvalue() doesnothing
Thu Oct 17 00:35:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetValue() is an inherited method from item
Thu Oct 17 00:35:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does exactly what any other setValue does
Thu Oct 17 00:35:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:GetValue(), hwoever, overroides that
Thu Oct 17 00:40:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with amylaar, catch_tell()
Thu Oct 17 00:41:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:f = 0;
Thu Oct 17 00:53:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not supposed to describe it in the room
Thu Oct 17 00:54:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just do it in the doorm, and what you entered as a id and desc will automaticallybe added
Thu Oct 17 00:55:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:id you SetDoor() inthe oom?
Thu Oct 17 00:55:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you must have missed something...
Thu Oct 17 00:55:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though it would be hard to judge from here
Thu Oct 17 00:58:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you said string array, mapping
Thu Oct 17 00:59:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you said: you're supposed to put SetSide( ({ "north", "south" }) : ([ "id" : "door",    right?
Thu Oct 17 00:59:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is SetSide(string array, mapping)
Thu Oct 17 00:59:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the method is SetSie(string, mapping)
Thu Oct 17 01:01:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no idea
Thu Oct 17 01:08:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:override eventUnlock()
Thu Oct 17 01:08:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:hmm... canOpen() or canUnlock(0 is better
Thu Oct 17 01:11:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically, you rewrite the function which already exists
Thu Oct 17 01:11:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:similar to a special hit with weapons
Thu Oct 17 01:12:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:neither
Thu Oct 17 01:12:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well... you need to understand the concept of a method override
Thu Oct 17 01:12:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whichis a deep subject for just before I go to bed
Thu Oct 17 01:13:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it's all that money DB Jr. gets when daddy is gone
Thu Oct 17 01:14:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:CanOpen() :)
Thu Oct 17 01:14:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you were right the first time :)
Thu Oct 17 01:14:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in close.c
Thu Oct 17 01:15:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:showtree CanOpen /lib/door.c
Thu Oct 17 01:15:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tyep it and see :)
Thu Oct 17 01:15:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it isa vry cool command Beek wrote
Thu Oct 17 01:16:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't need NM
Thu Oct 17 01:16:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the same command by the same person on Lima
Thu Oct 17 01:17:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not over intercre, and not just before bed :)
Thu Oct 17 01:22:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Thu Oct 17 01:22:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can
Thu Oct 17 01:22:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just told you how
Thu Oct 17 01:22:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unfotunately, you understandably do nothave the background to do method overriding
Thu Oct 17 01:22:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't expect you would
Thu Oct 17 01:23:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know you don;t
Thu Oct 17 01:23:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but there is nothing I am going to say over intercre that will make you understand that
Thu Oct 17 01:23:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I know of know examples topoint you to
Thu Oct 17 01:23:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:know of no
Thu Oct 17 01:41:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:will be fixed in next mudos release
Thu Oct 17 11:37:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you do it before ::create() or after?
Thu Oct 17 11:40:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's the problem :)
Thu Oct 17 11:41:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:AddSave() must come firsty
Thu Oct 17 11:46:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what are you inheriting?
Thu Oct 17 11:49:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I really could not tell you what is wrong... look to what you have recently modified
Thu Oct 17 12:54:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Thu Oct 17 12:55:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, thanks :)
Thu Oct 17 14:44:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eodon is an old 3 yeard old mulib :)
Thu Oct 17 14:46:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:philosophy?
Thu Oct 17 14:46:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chemistry?
Thu Oct 17 14:46:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:phil is the first science
Thu Oct 17 14:48:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Thu Oct 17 14:49:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not
Thu Oct 17 14:50:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:philosophy and science are about the same thing
Thu Oct 17 14:50:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they take different approaches
Thu Oct 17 14:51:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO, complimentary approaches.... some people like to sit and argue which one has a monopoly on the truth though
Thu Oct 17 14:52:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know the difference, and I don't care :)
Thu Oct 17 14:53:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the actual discussion to whcih youwere referring though Blue was not about phil vs science... it was whether I had a degreein reality :)
Thu Oct 17 14:59:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a bullet and a gun
Thu Oct 17 16:15:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:stairmaster is hard
Thu Oct 17 16:16:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has gaseous attack
Thu Oct 17 16:17:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh... I got thrown in jail on my first mud for attacking goplayer in a no combart pub
Thu Oct 17 16:18:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that player's name was Kant... I could not figur eout how to get out of jail, so I started a player named Descartes
Thu Oct 17 16:21:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I gather that worked well? :)
Thu Oct 17 16:41:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what id you want a group of people who manage the eb stuff?
Thu Oct 17 16:41:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create a WEB group, stick those cres in it, and they edit web stuff andnothing else
Thu Oct 17 16:42:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Sia: add CMDS to read.cfg for realms/
Thu Oct 17 16:43:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:none :)
Thu Oct 17 16:44:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos was not written as a GUI app, and the transition with shutting down is a little rough
Thu Oct 17 16:47:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:new release for v22b19 perhaps this weekend
Thu Oct 17 16:47:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the only problem with it not in the main mudos is the shutdown problem
Thu Oct 17 16:50:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:type mudlist
Thu Oct 17 16:50:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:a lot of people se it
Thu Oct 17 16:50:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:use it
Thu Oct 17 16:51:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be  a loadofnonsense
Thu Oct 17 16:52:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the core of the code is identical
Thu Oct 17 16:55:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then don't switch
Thu Oct 17 16:56:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to some degree or another
Thu Oct 17 16:59:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the next major a major general
Thu Oct 17 17:36:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... the expression Yeltsin == moron seems to jump to mind
Thu Oct 17 17:53:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dole is dogmeat
Thu Oct 17 17:56:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably the green party candidate
Thu Oct 17 17:56:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or somthing else
Thu Oct 17 17:57:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I owuld only vote for a major party canbdidate if it were a close race and one of the candidates wa s amajor loser like Dole
Thu Oct 17 18:12:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:making an area or two?
Thu Oct 17 18:12:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:we need new areas that will take advantage of the new stuff we have... undead and sky domains and such
Thu Oct 17 18:15:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you can take the NM combat system and do a lot of creative things with it without writing the combat over
Thu Oct 17 18:15:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the greatest way a mud can differentiate itself is in creative areas
Thu Oct 17 18:18:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that's verynice, but wouldn't it have more impact Drig to coded something someone actually needed?
Thu Oct 17 18:19:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:so, then, please let me understand what it is you bring to a mud you would be codding for?  coding stuff you want to write?
Thu Oct 17 18:20:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not really :)
Thu Oct 17 18:20:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:ever heard the expression necessity is themother of invention?
Thu Oct 17 18:22:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:an area builder is a part time sorta thing
Thu Oct 17 18:22:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, Nightmare is without a doubt better than TMI
Thu Oct 17 18:23:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, it is very, very different
Thu Oct 17 18:24:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:verything
Thu Oct 17 18:25:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, first off it has a coherent, thoguth out object oriented design
Thu Oct 17 18:26:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:TMI-2 is random "I think this would be cool" stuff put together by a hodge podge of coders
Thu Oct 17 18:27:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really Ravnos
Thu Oct 17 18:27:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first off, there is Lima and Discworld :)
Thu Oct 17 18:27:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and thus there is no situations which would suggest using TMI-2 as the answer :)
Thu Oct 17 18:29:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yes, Dearak, that is necessarily a bad thing
Thu Oct 17 18:29:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a bunch of people adding what they think is cool doesnot make for a consistent system that works well as a whole
Thu Oct 17 18:30:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok...
Thu Oct 17 18:30:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it has a well defined API to which it is written
Thu Oct 17 18:30:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not comparable systems
Thu Oct 17 18:30:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a mudlib is a library of classes which are supposed to interoperate
Thu Oct 17 18:31:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a UNIX OS is a bunch of modules which may or may not need to work together
Thu Oct 17 18:34:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I would love to invite anyone interested in area coding on a NM mud to come here and contribute to NM mud thoguh
Thu Oct 17 18:35:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I am not too interested in people running their own muds, no
Thu Oct 17 18:35:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:doing meaningful coding on multiple muds is rarely done
Thu Oct 17 18:37:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:nothing... the mudlib is pretty damn solid after 3 years of development :)
Thu Oct 17 18:38:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, I am working on a Java clinet for NM
Thu Oct 17 19:44:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you are standing in the room with the bulletin board
Thu Oct 17 19:45:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:becauas eht ebulletin boards suck :)
Thu Oct 17 20:33:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean two cheap NM copies?
Thu Oct 17 20:36:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe I shouldn''t
Thu Oct 17 20:36:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would stop yahoos from making cheap copies, changing the main town and claiming thy have done NM better than NM :)
Thu Oct 17 20:38:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever :)
Thu Oct 17 20:39:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sure every NM player has his own idea of what would make NM better... why donm't they all start their own mud using the code I wrote and then we all can have muds with no players
Thu Oct 17 22:57:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:if your security is so lame as to use this_player()
Thu Oct 17 22:58:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Thu Oct 17 22:59:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all_previous_objects() has nothing to do with this_player()
Thu Oct 17 22:59:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:regular cres could never add races
Thu Oct 17 23:00:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that is setting a monster race. not adding a ne wone
Thu Oct 17 23:01:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetRace() sets an individual monster's race
Thu Oct 17 23:01:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the addrace commands addss races
Thu Oct 17 23:13:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I HATE sticking the data type before the name
Thu Oct 17 23:14:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:globals?
Thu Oct 17 23:14:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's an attribute :)
Thu Oct 17 23:15:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what the hell are you talking about ciao?
Thu Oct 17 23:15:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:static in LPC means save object does not save it
Thu Oct 17 23:16:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC does not have class mthods or class attributes
Thu Oct 17 23:16:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a real limitaton
Thu Oct 17 23:17:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why? create a central daemon you do not clone?  class emthods and attributes ismply don't fit the LPC paradigm
Thu Oct 17 23:17:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ciao there is never a reaosn to use a global
Thu Oct 17 23:17:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and LPC does not let you use them
Thu Oct 17 23:20:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:either
Thu Oct 17 23:20:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one sec... afk
Thu Oct 17 23:40:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:avatar is level 50 or higher
Thu Oct 17 23:44:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a player cannot login with an undefined race
Thu Oct 17 23:45:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot choose a race that doe snot exist
Thu Oct 17 23:46:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Janus, I just checked the code and tested it
Thu Oct 17 23:47:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, upgrade from what?
Thu Oct 17 23:47:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not a major upgrade
Thu Oct 17 23:48:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what your rpbolem would be, but it is likely unique to your situation
Thu Oct 17 23:49:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare has a few players and there wrere not problems :)
Thu Oct 17 23:49:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Despair, the race daemon only deals with newly created objects, not pre-existing players
Thu Oct 17 23:55:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:inherit LIB_PUSH
Thu Oct 17 23:55:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and use the PRESS I mean
Thu Oct 17 23:55:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and then SetPress()
Thu Oct 17 23:55:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though that object might be broken in your release
Thu Oct 17 23:56:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what config problem?
Thu Oct 17 23:56:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, that, I doubt it
Thu Oct 17 23:56:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not a no :)
Thu Oct 17 23:57:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you upgraded your read.cfg files, which you hsould not do when upgrading :)
Thu Oct 17 23:57:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know, ficx the problem and see if virtuals work :)
Fri Oct 18 00:21:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Fri Oct 18 00:21:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:keen
Fri Oct 18 00:32:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably a crash ":)
Fri Oct 18 00:33:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a crash on NM is no worse than going net-dead
Fri Oct 18 00:33:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you pick iup exactly where you left off :)
Fri Oct 18 00:34:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Fri Oct 18 00:37:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayup
Fri Oct 18 00:38:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the new mudos fixes this crasher... Beek just has not had time to upload it yet
Fri Oct 18 01:07:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes
Fri Oct 18 01:07:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:depending on what you are meaning :)
Fri Oct 18 01:07:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I doubt that means what you want it to mean
Fri Oct 18 11:11:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes
Fri Oct 18 11:17:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use eventMove()
Fri Oct 18 11:17:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ob->eventMove()
Fri Oct 18 11:18:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not supposed to use move_object() in NM :)
Fri Oct 18 11:35:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you hit, hit really well, then you missed
Fri Oct 18 14:24:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:come on, set() isn't bad enough yet! it needs ot be made worse!
Fri Oct 18 14:29:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:@@foo???
Fri Oct 18 14:30:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ever heard of fucntion pointers?
Fri Oct 18 14:30:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean that code has not been rewritten in 4 years?
Fri Oct 18 14:31:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, I am truely amazed people use that
Fri Oct 18 14:31:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more so than before
Fri Oct 18 14:37:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it still is not done right :)
Fri Oct 18 14:38:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such thing
Fri Oct 18 14:38:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which would be a really bad idea cause they could have pending callouts and state information that needs being transferred
Fri Oct 18 14:39:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, eventdestruct() :)
Fri Oct 18 14:39:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:capital D

Fri Oct 18 21:48:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the shops are not the problem, your economy is
Fri Oct 18 21:51:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the eonomy command
Fri Oct 18 21:51:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the currency command
Fri Oct 18 21:52:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, just the economy command
Fri Oct 18 22:02:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Fri Oct 18 22:02:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you read help on the economy command?
Sat Oct 19 10:17:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java is horrendous?
Sat Oct 19 10:35:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wasnot aware |= worked with arrays
Sat Oct 19 10:36:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:normally, you would do: if( member_array(elem, arr) == -1 ) { arr += ({ elem })
Sat Oct 19 10:37:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aragorn says |= for arrays was added in the 221a alpha line
Sat Oct 19 12:38:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:some day... some day... some day, some day DOMINION
Sat Oct 19 12:41:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:anyone out there have any clue where the name of this mud comes frm?
Sat Oct 19 12:43:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:you people need to learn about good music
Sat Oct 19 14:38:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Raid on NM :)
Sat Oct 19 14:55:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:goblins
Sat Oct 19 15:04:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with something a little moremodern than LPMud 2.4.5 there is :)
Sat Oct 19 15:06:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not in stock 2.4.5
Sat Oct 19 15:11:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Sat Oct 19 16:37:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:germ works just fine as long as your mud is not made up of morons
Sat Oct 19 16:38:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Qaexly, not quite
Sat Oct 19 16:38:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:germs are not particularly dangerous
Sat Oct 19 16:39:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:except to players
Sat Oct 19 16:39:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless, I suppose, your mud is destiny
Sat Oct 19 16:39:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ein your release, yes
Sat Oct 19 16:39:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specifically, the syntax of smells changed a bit
Sat Oct 19 16:40:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I think it is good for players to turn creators at some point
Sat Oct 19 16:41:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or he doesnot speak English well
Sat Oct 19 16:41:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then kindly shut the fuck up
Sat Oct 19 16:42:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yet another Nightmare copy mud?
Sat Oct 19 16:43:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sure you would... that would only serve to change you from copycat to thief though
Sat Oct 19 16:44:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry Myth :)
Sat Oct 19 16:49:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ignore the IVr4 corpse code, it does not work quite right
Sat Oct 19 16:51:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is all fixed for IVr5
Sat Oct 19 16:52:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am waiting on Beek to release v22b19 :)
Sat Oct 19 16:53:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:number + ""
Sat Oct 19 16:54:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is fixed in v22b19
Sat Oct 19 16:54:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I already did
Sat Oct 19 16:54:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:x + ""
Sat Oct 19 16:55:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the DOD mainframe
Sat Oct 19 16:55:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the thing that launches missles at the bad guys
Sat Oct 19 16:56:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the bad guys are defined as anyone welaunch missles at
Sat Oct 19 16:56:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:telnet 127.0.0.1 nntp
Sat Oct 19 16:57:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek has more insight than he needs
Sat Oct 19 16:57:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he fixed it
Sat Oct 19 16:58:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, leto, he was gonna release, but then he thought, that damn dutchman will get it
Sat Oct 19 16:58:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the bad one
Sat Oct 19 16:59:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we could get the netherlands and belgium with one good shot
Sat Oct 19 17:13:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should see what happens when a player falls from the sky on NM
Sat Oct 19 17:14:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, they may or may not drop dead
Sat Oct 19 17:14:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but if they do not, they are in serious shit :)
Sat Oct 19 17:44:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:multi-hand == no hands?
Sat Oct 19 17:46:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, shit, looks like that is a bugin the fighter configuration or something
Sat Oct 19 17:47:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:sorry, no, I am spacng
Sat Oct 19 17:47:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare: multi-hand is two or moe handed weapons
Sat Oct 19 17:48:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:multi-weapon is using two or mroe weapons
Sat Oct 19 17:59:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Oct 19 17:59:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hadbutss can work anyways :)
Sat Oct 19 17:59:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, I don't think that level of realism is worth the trouble
Sat Oct 19 18:00:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which of course is entirely arguable
Sat Oct 19 18:00:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a little bit for the npc, and little for the battle
Sat Oct 19 18:01:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:players love flying limbs
Sat Oct 19 18:01:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not actually flying ones
Sat Oct 19 18:02:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem with doing that is what constitutes a limb that could bve used for combat?
Sat Oct 19 18:04:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has wielding limbs for wielding weapons
Sat Oct 19 18:04:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if you lose that limb, you lose the weaponm
Sat Oct 19 18:04:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is what constitutes a melee limb
Sat Oct 19 18:05:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and wielding limb is not a flag
Sat Oct 19 18:05:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is assumed if you can stick a weapon in it, thenit can wield things :)
Sat Oct 19 18:05:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I agree though, I do not want a "melee combat flag" for limbs
Sat Oct 19 18:05:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially since I cannot conceive of a non-combat limb
Sat Oct 19 18:06:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:torso and head left neverhappens
Sat Oct 19 18:06:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the shock of the loss of the rest of the limbs is enough to kill anything
Sat Oct 19 23:25:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any mudlib will run on any oprating system
Sat Oct 19 23:25:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC is a platform independnet language
Sat Oct 19 23:27:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only packaged driver binary I know of is the NM/MudOS package
Sat Oct 19 23:28:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it comes with an installshield installation process for win32
Sat Oct 19 23:29:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that's not what I did Zifnab
Sat Oct 19 23:30:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the NM package uses the normal win32 setup process... you don't need to edit any configuration files or anything
Sat Oct 19 23:31:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doesn't matter
Sat Oct 19 23:31:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, a TCP/IP hookup
Sat Oct 19 23:32:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which can be PPP, SLIP, whatever
Sat Oct 19 23:33:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare has all NM docs
Sat Oct 19 23:40:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM needs area coders :)
Sat Oct 19 23:42:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which may or may not be string array... inthis case,it is certainly not an array ormapping of any type
Sat Oct 19 23:42:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, DEFAULTS[0] os nnot a string array
Sat Oct 19 23:42:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:chose just 1 :)
Sat Oct 19 23:43:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is wrong is that DEFAULTS[0] is not a string array
Sat Oct 19 23:43:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means DEFAULTS[0][0] is indexing on an illegal type
Sat Oct 19 23:44:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, then DEFAULTS is not a string array
Sat Oct 19 23:44:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just because you declare it as such does not make it such
Sat Oct 19 23:45:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means it is probably 0
Sat Oct 19 23:45:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a string or an array or a mapping
Sat Oct 19 23:47:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no problem :)
Sat Oct 19 23:55:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it works for m
Sat Oct 19 23:56:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the ftpd that I make available that I have used unaltered for years
Sat Oct 19 23:57:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope, because I don't support it
Sat Oct 19 23:57:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is there if you want to use it
Sat Oct 19 23:57:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it works, great, if it don't, sorry
Sat Oct 19 23:58:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean?
Sat Oct 19 23:58:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ftp to a port specificially tied in with mud user files
Sun Oct 20 00:35:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, but the timnezones daemon is off a bit
Sun Oct 20 00:35:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:take a look at /cfg/whatever
Sun Oct 20 14:27:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:0 is complete darkness, 100 is pure light
Sun Oct 20 16:30:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:none
Sun Oct 20 16:32:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Sun Oct 20 16:40:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:dinner, bbiaf
Sun Oct 20 19:48:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and the problem with that is?
Sun Oct 20 19:49:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:#1 lynx supports frames
Sun Oct 20 19:49:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:#2 type ./Configure and you are all set
Sun Oct 20 19:49:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it supports it so you can read theinstall docs
Sun Oct 20 19:51:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:get a real web browser second
Sun Oct 20 19:52:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:if you do not have 100 MB hard drive, you are in a world of shit anyways
Sun Oct 20 19:53:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:sounds like a serious personal problem
Sun Oct 20 19:54:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am trying to udnerstand what the problem is with me keeping install instructionson the web...
Sun Oct 20 19:54:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and this dumbfuck second guessing kinds ticks me off
Sun Oct 20 19:54:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Sun Oct 20 19:55:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, then too bad :)
Sun Oct 20 19:55:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:we are talking about braindead instructions :)
Sun Oct 20 19:55:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not rocket science :)
Sun Oct 20 19:56:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the building docs are in the lib :)
Sun Oct 20 19:57:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:imaginary.com has been down maybe a grand total of 35 hours in the last 9 months :)
Sun Oct 20 19:57:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:err 5
Sun Oct 20 20:13:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:is that so an "in order to"?
Sun Oct 20 22:06:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depends on what you mean...
Sun Oct 20 22:07:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are several possibilities
Sun Oct 20 22:07:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:present("id") is true of any item matching that id, including its corpse
Sun Oct 20 22:08:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ob = present("id"); living(id);
Sun Oct 20 22:08:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:living(ob) Imean
Sun Oct 20 22:16:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:put them in the SECURE or ASSIST groups
Mon Oct 21 06:27:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:were you guys earlier talking about shop buying limits?
Mon Oct 21 06:29:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:guess not :)
Mon Oct 21 06:51:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you can use pointer types too
Mon Oct 21 06:52:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:arrays and mappings can generally be nonsensical as keys, but there are situations in which they are useful
Mon Oct 21 07:45:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:is a restore_object() done which would return it to 0?
Mon Oct 21 07:45:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:better yet, what is the error you are encountering?
Mon Oct 21 07:46:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:did you ever pass the mapping to another object?
Mon Oct 21 07:47:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:or return it as a return value?
Mon Oct 21 07:48:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it is returned as a reference
Mon Oct 21 07:49:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:if you are modiying that mapping in whatever requests it, then the original is being changed
Mon Oct 21 07:49:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no such thing
Mon Oct 21 07:50:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:mappings are always passed by reference
Mon Oct 21 07:50:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:as are objects and arrays
Mon Oct 21 07:50:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and classes
Mon Oct 21 07:50:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you have to explicitly copy a mapping to create a copy
Mon Oct 21 07:51:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, somewhere, somehow, you are changing the mapping before you query it :)
Mon Oct 21 07:51:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the task is to find all possible poinbts of modification
Mon Oct 21 07:54:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:then you know that mappingname is ([])
Mon Oct 21 07:54:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:oyu need to find out how it got that way
Mon Oct 21 07:54:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:probably mappingname[ob] = foo; never happened
Mon Oct 21 08:03:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not with Lima
Mon Oct 21 08:03:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:probably
Mon Oct 21 08:12:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, but ti works with NM IVr5 and not with IVr4
Mon Oct 21 08:38:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you wuld inherit LIB_ITEMS
Mon Oct 21 08:38:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you would have to override GetLong() and eventShow() in a trivial manner
Mon Oct 21 08:38:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Mon Oct 21 13:42:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:instead of Q?
Mon Oct 21 13:56:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be too easy, so I will be quiet :)
Mon Oct 21 14:27:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what goes up, must come down
Mon Oct 21 14:29:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:permission to fall!
Mon Oct 21 14:31:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:8 ball corner pocket
Mon Oct 21 14:57:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why are you starting amud?
Mon Oct 21 14:57:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why not find one you like and helpmake it better?
Mon Oct 21 14:58:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you.. why start an intentionally lame mud?
Mon Oct 21 15:00:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am serious, why not help make an existing mud rock?
Mon Oct 21 15:01:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Capper, coding an area is not rocket science
Mon Oct 21 15:01:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:certainly easier than running your own mud
Mon Oct 21 15:02:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Capper, so what exactly is it you think you are going to add to mudidng?
Mon Oct 21 15:03:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coding an area requries more creativity, coding the mudlib is harder development
Mon Oct 21 15:05:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I forgot, most people don't care if they build shit
Mon Oct 21 15:07:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek was right
Mon Oct 21 15:08:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ould love to hear a criticism of what he said though
Mon Oct 21 15:12:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Blue, but you can capture it when someone comes up with an idea soothers can useit
Mon Oct 21 15:13:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a good class library *for any language* captures complex functionality to be reused later
Mon Oct 21 15:14:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a good class library != diku
Mon Oct 21 15:17:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?
Mon Oct 21 15:18:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone should rewrite the wheel!
Mon Oct 21 15:19:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what having climb functionality?
Mon Oct 21 15:19:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most game specific stuff liesin the way you describe things
Mon Oct 21 15:19:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not in the way they happen
Mon Oct 21 15:20:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:give me anexample of game specific stuff you don't want in a mudlib?
Mon Oct 21 15:21:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so do i
Mon Oct 21 15:22:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is my opinion that wildly different worlds can be created using the same, unmodified mudlib
Mon Oct 21 15:22:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:now, of course, reality is that people just are not too damn creative and it doesnot happen as much as it should
Mon Oct 21 15:29:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but an aple is an apple no matter what mud you are on
Mon Oct 21 15:31:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you need?
Mon Oct 21 15:31:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct 21 15:31:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one is sayingthat
Mon Oct 21 15:31:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you do not havre to do special code to make an apple
Mon Oct 21 15:32:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hat you do is have your question monster say "POh, I have an apple, thank you"giver->AddQuest();
Mon Oct 21 15:35:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:responding to grinding should be a mudlib function
Mon Oct 21 15:35:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you simply customize that response
Mon Oct 21 15:36:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds like enough to piss any player off
Mon Oct 21 15:37:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well... what the mudlib should provide is the ability for objects to be ground and notifications when certain events occur
Mon Oct 21 15:37:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so yes, there should be :)
Mon Oct 21 15:38:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the quest itself is not in the mudlib
Mon Oct 21 15:39:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what you burn is irrelevant
Mon Oct 21 15:39:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that you can burn things is what maters
Mon Oct 21 15:40:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is also about the mudlib supporting object nburning
Mon Oct 21 15:40:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or objects grinding
Mon Oct 21 15:41:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the timing checks are really all there is to that (excepting of course some colourful phrases)
Mon Oct 21 15:45:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Blue, area code is not ZERO code
Mon Oct 21 15:45:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is trivial, short code only when necessary
Mon Oct 21 16:00:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning that coding a good area is header than building on top of NM? definitely
Mon Oct 21 16:00:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:harder than dong it yourself? no
Mon Oct 21 18:52:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuckin dork mud
Mon Oct 21 18:52:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one :) sorry :)
Mon Oct 21 18:53:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct 21 18:56:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in NM IVr5
Mon Oct 21 19:02:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I don't either, it is a naming conventions for idiots :)
Mon Oct 21 19:03:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what sort of diplomacy? :)
Mon Oct 21 19:03:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:mixed caps is good... that is not what I agree with :)
Mon Oct 21 19:03:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I don't like sticking event on the front of events
Mon Oct 21 19:04:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:problem is 90% of the people using NM don't know an event from a Get/Set method
Mon Oct 21 19:05:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:for idiots was rude ofme
Mon Oct 21 19:05:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:for people who are not experienced with coding
Mon Oct 21 19:05:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:in an event driven environment
Mon Oct 21 19:58:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not dead :) it is just not cobered in spam... howmuch could possibly be said about a mudlib?
Mon Oct 21 20:02:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:40 means that is the base around which a ne wplayer may start, give or take random points
Mon Oct 21 20:03:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the 3 is the importance, with 1 being a skill that counts against player level
Mon Oct 21 20:04:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:first number is 1-100, second 1-5
Tue Oct 22 08:18:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the perl function to get the cwd?
Tue Oct 22 08:19:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want the name of the dir, not ists contents :)
Tue Oct 22 08:22:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks bnoth of you :)
Tue Oct 22 08:23:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:next question, how to get environment variables?
Tue Oct 22 08:24:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Oct 22 08:28:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I actually have all the books :)
Tue Oct 22 08:30:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:machine language for humans
Tue Oct 22 09:15:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:getting an entire development staff up on SCCS is difficult :)
Tue Oct 22 09:16:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:*nod* the NM mudlib is handled in it
Tue Oct 22 09:17:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is the learning curve... I have set up some utilities on athens to make it easy though
Tue Oct 22 09:18:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sure :)
Tue Oct 22 09:19:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wrote up a doc for everyone on NM, so I will send it to ya
Tue Oct 22 12:45:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Chewy: this is delayed, but yes
Tue Oct 22 13:27:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you go back in your kill ring in emacs?
Wed Oct 23 01:10:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Lima Bean:bing
Wed Oct 23 01:11:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Lima Bean:bing!
Wed Oct 23 12:11:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or bings
Wed Oct 23 15:46:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in whatever it does to heal, have it destruct at the end
Wed Oct 23 16:49:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know of any good X server apps for NT
Wed Oct 23 20:17:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reset()
Wed Oct 23 20:19:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is so awesome about Dyrt?
Wed Oct 23 20:21:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like?
Wed Oct 23 20:21:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:miney?
Wed Oct 23 20:22:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Wed Oct 23 20:22:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LP hasmoney if you want it, and it does not if you do not
Wed Oct 23 20:22:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some mudlibs come with money while some do not
Wed Oct 23 20:23:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you keep your stuff in some LP's and you do not in others
Wed Oct 23 20:23:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:login to nightmare.imaginary.com 1701 to see what a real LP looks like :)
Wed Oct 23 20:24:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:almost no one has Abr/Dyrt
Wed Oct 23 20:24:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the ovrwhelming majority of muds are LP
Wed Oct 23 20:25:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so what?
Wed Oct 23 20:25:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is simple to build areas in LPC, and some libs have area editors
Wed Oct 23 21:28:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because of the way your intermud support is coded
Wed Oct 23 21:29:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hahahah?
Wed Oct 23 21:30:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange: the deal is that is not how you move objects
Wed Oct 23 21:31:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ob->eventMove(destination) for general objects, or living->eventMoeLiving(destinaton)
Wed Oct 23 21:31:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Taffel: don't use move_object()
Wed Oct 23 21:32:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no Shalandar
Wed Oct 23 21:32:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I already stated what it should be
Wed Oct 23 21:33:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:YOU DON'T USE move_object() on NM mudlibs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wed Oct 23 21:33:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:objects: ob->eventMove(destination); livings: ob->eventMoveLiving(destination)
Wed Oct 23 21:34:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do i need to repeat that again?
Wed Oct 23 21:35:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't use move_object() PERIOD with NM
Wed Oct 23 21:37:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:move_object() is an efun
Wed Oct 23 21:37:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Oct 23 21:38:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM is a sane mudlib that encapsulates a lot of mudos functionality
Wed Oct 23 21:39:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you did, and I said it uses different mudos options
Wed Oct 23 21:39:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you compile it differently to use Lima and differently to use Discworld
Wed Oct 23 21:41:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that is not why you don't use move_objuect() on NM
Wed Oct 23 21:41:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't use move_object() because NM encapsulates all thigns associated with moving an object inside an efun
Wed Oct 23 21:41:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:likemaking sure mass is distributed properly, move checks are made, etc
Wed Oct 23 21:42:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and your point is what?
Wed Oct 23 21:43:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who asked if you could?
Wed Oct 23 21:46:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh he did ask that? :) well if he did, I certainly do not recall saying you can't use it on NM :)
Wed Oct 23 21:51:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:login to nightmare.imaginary.com 1701 and get a feel for LPMuds
Wed Oct 23 22:06:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:easier to understand than what?
Wed Oct 23 22:08:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course
Wed Oct 23 22:13:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I agree
Wed Oct 23 22:13:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it so happens 80 muds on this line use tha % ^ protocol
Wed Oct 23 22:13:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you do use something else
Wed Oct 23 22:21:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IE has autowiz on and better code :)
Wed Oct 23 22:28:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:based on what?
Wed Oct 23 22:28:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how is it easier?
Wed Oct 23 22:29:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:compared to the mess that is TMI-2?
Wed Oct 23 22:29:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:can't you tell me?
Wed Oct 23 22:30:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like????
Wed Oct 23 22:31:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:tell me one thing that is easier?
Wed Oct 23 22:32:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:coding an LP is easy
Wed Oct 23 22:32:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you don't know about LP, what the hell are you doing making claims about it?
Wed Oct 23 22:33:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how is that?
Wed Oct 23 22:33:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is Dyrt the end to ease in codding?
Wed Oct 23 22:34:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:should all software developers drop the tools they are using to build systems and use Dyt?
Wed Oct 23 22:34:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are a lot of LP's, and some are not so hot
Wed Oct 23 22:38:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sure
Wed Oct 23 22:40:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I fixed it!
Wed Oct 23 22:41:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just upgraded IE
Wed Oct 23 22:44:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool :)
Thu Oct 24 13:37:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I told you about TMI-2
Thu Oct 24 13:55:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:foreach(key, element in mapping)
Thu Oct 24 13:58:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Thu Oct 24 13:59:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Oct 24 14:00:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you need more than 5 per-second, I owuld not go with mSQL
Thu Oct 24 14:02:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't think that owuld be good.. you would probably mess up database integrity that way
Thu Oct 24 14:02:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless they are 100% read operations
Thu Oct 24 14:02:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for that kind of stress, I would really go with something commercial
Thu Oct 24 14:03:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shit :)
Thu Oct 24 14:04:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are also going to run into a CGI problem
Thu Oct 24 14:04:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:50/sec is vry hard for CGI to deal with unless you are using NSAPI or the like
Thu Oct 24 20:26:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:TMI-2... must be awesome
Thu Oct 24 20:38:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coders whose goal is to do nothing
Thu Oct 24 20:38:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how admirable
Thu Oct 24 20:42:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:please explain
Thu Oct 24 20:43:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:explain your comment
Thu Oct 24 20:56:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Thu Oct 24 21:06:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so?
Thu Oct 24 21:07:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is a driver apply
Thu Oct 24 21:08:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what mudlib are you talking about?
Thu Oct 24 21:08:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, probably you would use catch(_tell()
Thu Oct 24 21:09:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but catch_tell() is goofy
Thu Oct 24 21:09:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and inconsistent... fits really well with TMI-2
Thu Oct 24 21:09:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it is dependent on the situation and what messaging efuns were used
Thu Oct 24 21:11:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, not in a room
Thu Oct 24 21:11:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only in a living
Thu Oct 24 21:13:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Oct 24 21:20:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:visit LPMud hell
Thu Oct 24 21:21:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:JokeTMI
Thu Oct 24 21:22:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:going over what code?
Fri Oct 25 12:31:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how can I get Microsoft Fax to answer the fax modem without having that stupid as exchange inbox open all the time?
Fri Oct 25 23:31:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:trim(str) will strip leading and training whitespace
Fri Oct 25 23:32:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Claire did not ask if it was hard.. she asked if there was a function to do it
Fri Oct 25 23:34:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:do you know anything about good programming Ciao?
Fri Oct 25 23:34:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:oh yeah, on a TMI-2 mud... nuff said
Fri Oct 25 23:35:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:by the way... trim() is not a 1 line function
Fri Oct 25 23:35:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and it is a NM simul efun
Fri Oct 25 23:41:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what???
Fri Oct 25 23:41:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:str[0..0] is your solution?
Fri Oct 25 23:42:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is your whiz-bang one-liner?
Fri Oct 25 23:42:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle you do not have to recompile the addr server
Fri Oct 25 23:43:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:please repeat that solution
Fri Oct 25 23:43:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a recompile will change nothing
Fri Oct 25 23:43:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wrong ciao
Fri Oct 25 23:44:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I suppose I could stick my entire simul on one line and it would be a one-liner too
Fri Oct 25 23:44:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a sspace is not the only kind of whitespace
Fri Oct 25 23:45:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:talk to Beek... but it is not a recompile that is ficxing your problem
Fri Oct 25 23:46:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nothing is going to corrupt an addr server
Fri Oct 25 23:46:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is nothing different from the first time you run it to the next
Fri Oct 25 23:46:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it accounts for all types of whitespace
Fri Oct 25 23:46:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Aristotle, but a recompile is not what fixes it :)
Fri Oct 25 23:47:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my point exactly Vashkar :)
Fri Oct 25 23:47:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the fact that Ciao's simul does not even do hat it needs to do is just a bonus :)
Fri Oct 25 23:48:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would say one that seg faults udner difficult to reproduce circumstances
Fri Oct 25 23:49:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ciao, so your point is that every time someone needs a trim(), they instead write the 3-5 lines of junk you are talking about?
Fri Oct 25 23:49:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yours does not remove all whitespace
Fri Oct 25 23:49:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right Aristotle
Fri Oct 25 23:50:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:two lines bunched up together that do not do the jopb ;)
Fri Oct 25 23:50:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ever heard of code reuse ?
Fri Oct 25 23:50:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:encapsulating common functionality in a simple, pre-defined interface?
Fri Oct 25 23:53:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, Ciao... let's say everywhere people needed trim functionality, they used your spaghetti...
Fri Oct 25 23:53:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then suddenly, someone realizes... DOH! We need to count tabs as whitespace
Fri Oct 25 23:53:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whoop!  Have to go rewrite every instance of that spaghetti throughought the mud
Fri Oct 25 23:54:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then, 2 months later, a new mudos efun is written that will speed up the calculation of your trim...
Fri Oct 25 23:54:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeeehaw!!!  Get to go recode all those lines yet again
Fri Oct 25 23:57:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any possible defense of making each coder do those "2" lines themselves Ciao? :)
Sat Oct 26 00:00:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there know what the mud Dead Souls is anmed after?
Sat Oct 26 00:01:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:either older or younger than you :)
Sat Oct 26 00:02:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Grateful dead fortunately are now

Sat Oct 26 12:45:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a function
Sat Oct 26 12:46:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it will catch and thrown errors
Sat Oct 26 12:46:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:catch(ob->foo());
Sat Oct 26 12:46:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if an error occurs in foo() it will catch it
Mon Oct 28 17:56:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you need?
Mon Oct 28 17:57:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I don't know sounds
Mon Oct 28 18:22:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shield string?
Mon Oct 28 19:37:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are trying to force an object to behave in a certain way?
Mon Oct 28 19:38:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use a pre-exit method
Mon Oct 28 19:55:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Oct 28 19:57:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Mon Oct 28 19:58:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not in the sens you might be thinking of
Mon Oct 28 19:58:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do varargs method(mixed val)
Mon Oct 28 19:59:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean overriding?
Mon Oct 28 20:00:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it uses the tpmost version of the method
Mon Oct 28 20:00:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what every create() method you write is
Mon Oct 28 20:07:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why can't you use a pre-exit?
Mon Oct 28 20:24:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why are you doing that?
Mon Oct 28 20:25:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I still don't see why you cannot use ian exit?
Tue Oct 29 14:03:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i do :)
Tue Oct 29 14:06:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:be quiet... they might let me be a cre
Tue Oct 29 14:12:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not sure I understand exactly what you are asking... SetInventory() will clone each reset enough of an object so that the room has how ever many you specify
Tue Oct 29 14:17:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Oct 29 14:28:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:request  ight be broke
Tue Oct 29 14:37:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is probably request
Tue Oct 29 17:31:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:NM 3 or 4?
Tue Oct 29 17:32:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you don't use SetProperty() for NM Iv
Tue Oct 29 17:32:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it would be 1 or 0 for NM 3
Tue Oct 29 17:33:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:0 means not indoors, 1 means indoors
Tue Oct 29 17:33:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:hi Y
Tue Oct 29 17:35:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:ok, hi sinistrad
Tue Oct 29 17:40:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:fyi though.. this channel is not a place to say hi :) that is intergossip
Tue Oct 29 17:46:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:sinistrad, I believe your mud was one of the motivating factos behind multiple lines on I3
Tue Oct 29 17:47:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:ayup :)
Tue Oct 29 17:48:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I made the point about changing lines politely because I figured youmight be ignorant of multiple channels :) I am sorry Iknhaton turned this into an argument that you want too continue
Tue Oct 29 17:50:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:from what I can see, you called beek obvious first
Tue Oct 29 17:54:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:unfortunately lack of rationality on the part of my opponent has never stopped me from trying to argue a point
Tue Oct 29 19:36:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rehash works for cmds
Tue Oct 29 19:37:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but perhaps you should be using verbs
Tue Oct 29 19:45:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what exactly is it you are using to run a mud?
Tue Oct 29 19:46:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I wrote the mud you are on
Tue Oct 29 19:46:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and in a better mood
Tue Oct 29 19:56:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:need to change the perms on the /realms dir
Tue Oct 29 19:57:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Tue Oct 29 19:59:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably
Tue Oct 29 20:01:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, napir has a point... what you said will not work period :)
Tue Oct 29 20:02:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the eventMove() part
Tue Oct 29 20:03:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:move() will not work in other words
Tue Oct 29 20:04:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just because Netscape believes if it compiles it works does not mean you should believe that
Tue Oct 29 20:08:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just did
Tue Oct 29 20:11:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are pretty much none other than that for win32
Tue Oct 29 20:12:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what doyou mean it doe snot come with classes?
Tue Oct 29 20:13:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Nightmare LPMud doesnot give ut its classes for everyone else to copy
Tue Oct 29 20:14:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's the idea
Tue Oct 29 20:14:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not too keen on you having a mud just like NM
Tue Oct 29 20:15:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the value to the circle key should be an array not two values
Tue Oct 29 20:17:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, uncreative people ain't going to duplicate NM's undead system or the flying system :)
Tue Oct 29 20:17:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just what comes with the lib
Tue Oct 29 20:20:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not yet
Tue Oct 29 20:20:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably not til F III
Tue Oct 29 20:20:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:March 1997
Tue Oct 29 20:22:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM and Lima have zork parsing
Tue Oct 29 20:22:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:F III will have the parsing too as an option
Tue Oct 29 20:22:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right napir
Tue Oct 29 20:22:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, add CMDS to the perms for /realms
Tue Oct 29 20:24:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Oct 29 20:24:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM V is the final releaseof the curent beta
Tue Oct 29 20:25:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr4 is the beta for NMV
Tue Oct 29 20:25:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM and Foundation have nothing to do with one another
Tue Oct 29 20:25:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any more
Tue Oct 29 20:27:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can with NM IVr5... not with IVr4 and earlier
Tue Oct 29 20:31:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/cfg/read.cfg
Tue Oct 29 21:43:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:then you don't have a title
Tue Oct 29 21:43:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or you are doing something odd by checking if they have thenew title by fingering them
Tue Oct 29 21:44:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I am sure it will work itself out
Tue Oct 29 22:07:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:probably a bug in IVr4
Tue Oct 29 22:07:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:not really
Tue Oct 29 22:20:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no

Wed Oct 30 20:07:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, what was suggested is right
Wed Oct 30 20:08:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:because you are special
Wed Oct 30 20:08:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:it just won't work for you

Thu Oct 31 00:27:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:explain what?
Thu Oct 31 00:27:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it rocks
Thu Oct 31 00:27:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that is not the current list of arches
Thu Oct 31 00:27:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that is the list of all arches since the beginning of time
Thu Oct 31 00:30:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:it is Halloween
Thu Oct 31 00:30:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Player killing is illegal on NM except on Halloween
Thu Oct 31 00:31:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, there are the arenas
Thu Oct 31 00:31:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:2 people enter, 1 person leaves
Thu Oct 31 00:31:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:but that is rare
Thu Oct 31 00:31:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I guess you did not also happen to notice your character was erased :)
Thu Oct 31 00:32:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Tigran: neither do... but PK is unworkable in a mud
Thu Oct 31 00:32:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:unless you restrict it
Thu Oct 31 00:33:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I think NM has a good balanceon that
Thu Oct 31 00:33:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:people that have problems can challenge each other
Thu Oct 31 00:33:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:and rooms which require defense allow player killing too
Thu Oct 31 00:33:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Nightmare is also adding war periods too
Thu Oct 31 00:34:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:so like the monks and kataans can go to war
Thu Oct 31 00:35:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:it creates a class of asshole newbies
Thu Oct 31 00:36:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:there is no silver bullet answer
Thu Oct 31 00:36:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:NM has gone for a hybrid approach
Thu Oct 31 00:36:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:we allow PK zones
Thu Oct 31 00:36:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:special PK arens for challnges
Thu Oct 31 00:36:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:and war time
Thu Oct 31 00:50:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eventRceiveObject()
Thu Oct 31 01:03:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:showtree :)
Thu Oct 31 01:05:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:showtree tells you
Thu Oct 31 01:05:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not in generic objects
Thu Oct 31 01:05:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is in containers
Thu Oct 31 01:05:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since things like swords don't receive objects
Thu Oct 31 01:06:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you make it also use the container objects :)
Thu Oct 31 01:06:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what are you trying to do?
Thu Oct 31 01:08:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is nothing that allows that
Thu Oct 31 01:08:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not even init()
Thu Oct 31 01:09:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right Vashkar
Thu Oct 31 01:09:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not generally a useful thing
Thu Oct 31 01:10:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably the best thing is to stick an affect_area hook in containers
Thu Oct 31 01:11:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is too late for me to honestly think
Thu Oct 31 16:07:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:err .c
Thu Oct 31 18:25:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what is your problem?
Thu Oct 31 18:26:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what have you changed in combat?
Thu Oct 31 18:27:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, you had to change something, because combat works :)
Thu Oct 31 18:28:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:then look at your error logs
Thu Oct 31 18:29:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, the only non-bug poossibility si the two things cannot fight together
Thu Oct 31 18:30:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is a bug in the error log or they cannot fight because the room is no combat or something
Thu Oct 31 18:30:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there are no other options
Thu Oct 31 18:31:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:combat ok is the default
Thu Oct 31 18:32:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:my guess is thatyou are not reading the error logs :)
Thu Oct 31 18:33:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:definitely
Thu Oct 31 18:36:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the mud comes with combat ready
Thu Oct 31 18:36:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:if you cannot fight, then you have something you built which makes cmbat not work
Thu Oct 31 18:37:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Spectre: it is 0 at times for a reason
Thu Oct 31 18:38:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:will match that $5 and raise another $5
Thu Oct 31 18:38:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:then look at the error
Thu Oct 31 18:38:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:heart beats are turned off when an error occurrs during a hb
Thu Oct 31 19:01:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it tells you EXACTLY what is wrong
Thu Oct 31 19:09:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why don't you just say the error it specifies?
Thu Oct 31 19:09:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all that matters is the last line
Thu Oct 31 19:10:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, that is self-evident... I mean thr eone before the self-evident line
Thu Oct 31 19:11:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:that means your monster doesnot have any limbs
Thu Oct 31 19:12:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it is your imagination
Thu Oct 31 19:20:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:<nothing>

Fri Nov  1 13:27:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:modern languages are object oriented and use inheritance
Fri Nov  1 13:28:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:LPC actually has very little in common with C
Fri Nov  1 13:30:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean what is inherited where?

Sat Nov  2 11:36:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:err... nothing wrong here
Sat Nov  2 11:37:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what is your char Blackheart? Blackheart?
Sat Nov  2 11:38:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I ridded that.... corrupt .o file

Sat Nov  2 12:35:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:spectre... you did somethign worng in combat, look at your error lohgs
Sat Nov  2 13:00:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:check for somethign else... that certainly would have little to do with asomethign not dying

Sat Nov  2 13:11:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what is gg?
Sat Nov  2 14:54:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Sat Nov  2 14:57:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:look in eventDescribeEnvironment()
Sat Nov  2 15:01:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:/lib/interactive.c or /lib/interface.c... type showtree eventDescribeEnvironment /lib/player
Sat Nov  2 15:05:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what did you type?
Sat Nov  2 15:06:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:tack /lib/player onto the end
Sat Nov  2 15:09:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:you should read tghe code and get a good feel for what itis doing line by line there
Sat Nov  2 15:10:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:I dn't think -bis an option
Sat Nov  2 15:10:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:ahh... probably not initializing the string
Sat Nov  2 15:11:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Sat Nov  2 15:13:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I do not understand the queston
Sat Nov  2 15:17:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it allows you to enter a display name
Sat Nov  2 15:17:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:like 'This Is My Name'

Sat Nov  2 15:21:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:30 people or so
Sat Nov  2 15:30:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, it is not
Sat Nov  2 15:30:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and you shouldnot use init() with NM anyways
Sat Nov  2 15:31:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and also... the driver does not call reset() in NM muds
Sat Nov  2 15:32:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:reset() is called by the mudlib in rooms :)
Sat Nov  2 15:34:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:eventReceiveObject()
Sat Nov  2 15:53:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is no RL unit of measure
Sat Nov  2 15:53:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:call it whatever you want
Sat Nov  2 15:56:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:then do not code swords that weightmore thanhorses
Sat Nov  2 16:13:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not as such
Sat Nov  2 16:14:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we would like to, but no one seems to have the time :)

Sat Nov  2 18:02:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Nightmare has no more lag!
Sat Nov  2 18:04:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it means the driver crashed
Sat Nov  2 18:05:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:this is not a gossip line
Sat Nov  2 18:05:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:intercre and intergossip are the commands
Sat Nov  2 18:07:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no :)

Sat Nov  2 18:14:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:COMPAT is an archaic concept
Sat Nov  2 18:15:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it has no menaing in 1996 :)
Sat Nov  2 18:17:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:it means if you ask the question 'can I do X in a COMPAT mudlib?' the question conveys no menaing :)
Sat Nov  2 18:18:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes, anything can... the real question is it something you want to so?
Sat Nov  2 18:53:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:actually, solaris provides an immediate namservices resoltuon library
Sat Nov  2 19:37:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:none is the default
Sat Nov  2 22:00:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you lie
Sat Nov  2 22:41:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Zork is a keen fruit drink
Sat Nov  2 22:41:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not too lemony
Sun Nov  3 15:35:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:the errors logs in my experiencealmost always tell you where somethign went wrong
Sun Nov  3 15:35:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:what was?
Sun Nov  3 15:35:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:MudOS ALWAYS tells you were the error is
Sun Nov  3 15:35:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and it gives you a ton of information along with
Sun Nov  3 15:36:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:he talking about LPMud vs MudOS
Sun Nov  3 16:03:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Sun Nov  3 16:04:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:err, what do you mean "this should be iwiz"?
Sun Nov  3 16:19:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:several erors occurred there
Sun Nov  3 16:20:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:type elog
Sun Nov  3 16:20:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or elog obj
Sun Nov  3 16:20:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:#1 update encuntered an error it caught... that goes to the caught errors log
Sun Nov  3 16:21:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:#3 the error that caused the ctach() error goes to the log files for tat directory's errors
Sun Nov  3 16:23:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:or #2
Sun Nov  3 16:24:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:thanks, that is the catch log, where I told you the answer would NOT be found
Sun Nov  3 16:24:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:Gwarlm ARE YOU LISTENING???
Sun Nov  3 16:26:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes it is, elog obj
Sun Nov  3 16:28:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and what does the obj log tell you?
Sun Nov  3 17:27:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:type elog

Sun Nov  3 22:41:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:and it is still wrong
Sun Nov  3 22:43:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:GetName() si the proper method to call when you want to get the name ofrdisplay
Sun Nov  3 22:51:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :) I aprpeciate it
Mon Nov  4 06:34:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:less than a page of scrollback for an entire night
Mon Nov  4 17:38:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call_other() lets another object call a function in an object
Mon Nov  4 17:38:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Mon Nov  4 19:53:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or dance
Tue Nov  5 16:47:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you cannot
Tue Nov  5 16:47:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:unless you fudge it by passing a vaector
Tue Nov  5 17:59:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just follow the directions
Tue Nov  5 18:01:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no you don't
Tue Nov  5 18:02:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you follow the directions that come with the package

Tue Nov  5 18:04:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:they work fine
Tue Nov  5 18:06:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Tue Nov  5 18:07:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yo, Ferris piss off
Tue Nov  5 18:09:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:your directory does not have SECURE access
Tue Nov  5 18:23:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not another rip off mud
Tue Nov  5 18:24:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Nightmare

Tue Nov  5 18:28:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because Nightmare just crashed :)
Tue Nov  5 18:29:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:type dir
Tue Nov  5 18:29:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they should be links
Tue Nov  5 18:30:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I know the mudlib ones are links
Tue Nov  5 18:30:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:ell the beta is v22b21
Tue Nov  5 19:16:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so much for republican tax and spend claims
Tue Nov  5 19:16:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Dole wanted a 15% tax cut without specifying how
Tue Nov  5 19:17:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the deficit is Reagan's baby
Tue Nov  5 19:18:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the economy is undoubtedly stronger today than 4 years ago... nuff said :)
Tue Nov  5 19:18:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:(well besides the fact that Dole is an out of touch old boob
Tue Nov  5 19:19:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you misunderstand the stats Aritstotle
Tue Nov  5 19:19:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, I do understand... the guy in control of the economy is greenspan
Tue Nov  5 19:19:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that does not matter one bit
Tue Nov  5 19:19:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dole is still a boob
Tue Nov  5 19:20:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Clinton is not criminal
Tue Nov  5 19:20:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ethically challenged, yyes, criminal, no
Tue Nov  5 19:20:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dole is also ethically challenged
Tue Nov  5 19:21:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the character issue is so silly
Tue Nov  5 19:21:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the real issue is which Pres is more likely to cause you freedoms or do somehting so stupid as reduce taxes by 15% without cutting spending
Tue Nov  5 19:22:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know very well about the cirtues of reducing taxes
Tue Nov  5 19:23:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is stupid is Dole's wreckless, unbsupported attempts at it
Tue Nov  5 19:24:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yess... when you owe money, you do not ask your boss for a salary decrease unless you know of a way to budget your existing bills and pay off your debts
Tue Nov  5 19:24:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Bob Dole was just saying, Uncle Sam will take a pay cut!
Tue Nov  5 19:26:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aristotle, I know that
Tue Nov  5 19:26:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ay way too fucking much n taxes
Tue Nov  5 19:26:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unfortunately, it is not realistic to expect the government to cut down to my fair share without going broke
Tue Nov  5 19:27:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I vote for people who wish to cut taxes... if they say how they are going to pay for programs wthout that money
Tue Nov  5 19:28:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not vote for people which histpories of unwarranted spending either
Tue Nov  5 19:28:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Clinton actually has a very Republican record
Tue Nov  5 19:32:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I d not think they should do anything until 100% of the pole sin the US close
Tue Nov  5 19:33:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:declaring the game over while important non-presidential elections are going on out west s screwball
Tue Nov  5 19:34:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because people don't vote if they do not think their votes count
Tue Nov  5 19:35:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you could argue either way
Tue Nov  5 19:35:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not relevant though
Tue Nov  5 19:35:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is that it stops people from voting
Tue Nov  5 19:37:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Jesse Helm sis an evil fuckhead who shouldbe assassinated
Tue Nov  5 19:39:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:come on Blue, England even oppresses and murders people living right next door
Tue Nov  5 19:39:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Flood: properties are a tmi-2 travesty
Tue Nov  5 19:40:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you use methods to access values
Tue Nov  5 19:40:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not really Blue :)
Tue Nov  5 19:40:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:comparing American to England is like comparing republicans to Nazi's
Tue Nov  5 19:41:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean by administer?
Tue Nov  5 19:41:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to code them yourself
Tue Nov  5 19:42:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course, there is call and eval
Tue Nov  5 19:42:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Blue: as an American of Irish descent, I despise England
Tue Nov  5 19:43:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I were a racist, I would be intensely anti-anglo and anti-germanic
Tue Nov  5 19:43:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically
Tue Nov  5 19:43:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but England is the source of the politcal power of GB
Tue Nov  5 19:45:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not what I mean... I mean historically
Tue Nov  5 19:47:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he landslide and electoral projections are NOT based on thge popular vote count
Tue Nov  5 19:47:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are based on exit polls
Tue Nov  5 19:49:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Hi, I am Mark No Relation Warner
Tue Nov  5 19:54:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, yahoo has election results on its main page
Tue Nov  5 19:54:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Tue Nov  5 19:56:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, I do vote republican and democrat and everything in between :)
Tue Nov  5 19:57:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, in three elections I have never voted for the same paty in fact
Tue Nov  5 20:42:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Tue Nov  5 20:49:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:funny, R'aaza, I never said such a thing
Tue Nov  5 20:50:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though you are proving the latter to be true anyways
Tue Nov  5 20:50:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err former
Tue Nov  5 20:50:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's me, fucked in the head
Tue Nov  5 20:50:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:R'aaza you should run for creator on Dreamverse, you are just their type
Tue Nov  5 20:51:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he broke published rules
Tue Nov  5 20:57:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more than we had hen you were here :)
Tue Nov  5 20:58:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all time is 80
Tue Nov  5 20:59:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tht will probably happen again within 4 months
Tue Nov  5 21:00:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your what???? :)
Tue Nov  5 21:04:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where did I steal this idea from?
Tue Nov  5 21:04:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Blitz learned LPC from me :)
Tue Nov  5 21:05:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:*laugh*
Tue Nov  5 21:05:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 I doub the code looks anything alike, and if it does,m Blitz copied it from me
Tue Nov  5 21:06:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone on Earth knows that I coded NM IV with both flying and seas in mind
Tue Nov  5 21:06:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:beyond that, I did not even know he had flying
Tue Nov  5 21:06:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I doubt it is anything like NM's
Tue Nov  5 21:19:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that makes it better R'aaza.
Tue Nov  5 21:21:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:and how many D&D people arecres here? and were arches offered a head arch position>?
Tue Nov  5 21:22:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:lovely people
Tue Nov  5 21:30:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I cannot imagine a nice guy like Phanoongy would have anything to do with a twit like you
Tue Nov  5 21:40:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a fed offense for any american on american soil to threaten the pres... for good reason
Tue Nov  5 21:46:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Tue Nov  5 21:46:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't think e should have open borders, but we should not become a bunch of xenophic racists either
Tue Nov  5 21:47:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I lived closer to them
Tue Nov  5 21:47:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in fact, I could walk necxt door almost literally into Mexico

Tue Nov  5 21:48:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:interesting fact: if you go to Tiajuana, everyone there speaks EWnglish
Tue Nov  5 21:48:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but none of the Americans in SD speak Spanish
Tue Nov  5 21:48:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but Mexicans go to SD
Tue Nov  5 21:49:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and spend a lot of money there
Tue Nov  5 21:49:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bullshit Zakk
Tue Nov  5 21:49:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in Houston, the Galleria, one of the biggest tourist groups are mexicans
Tue Nov  5 21:53:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck it, why require people to go to school?
Tue Nov  5 22:17:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:funny, I never went to Walnut Bend
Tue Nov  5 22:19:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:R'aaza has done enough baseless bbashing of me tonight to handle any other possible needs to be a jerk by anyone else
Tue Nov  5 22:20:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:deny that Walnut Bend is next to PR? that would be curious of me to deny
Tue Nov  5 22:20:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, R'aaza, I am not pissed off at all
Tue Nov  5 22:21:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am just pointing out that you have done quite a bit of baseless bashing to make up for Zortek not wanting to get into an argument
Tue Nov  5 22:21:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I really don't care what you say
Tue Nov  5 22:21:32 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though I do intend to propose to Beek and Rust that DOG be banned from intermud
Tue Nov  5 22:23:00 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, ou distroted what i said
Tue Nov  5 22:25:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you violating the license?
Tue Nov  5 22:27:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the license is very explicit and in the file titles Agreement
Tue Nov  5 22:28:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh good, what would that be?
Tue Nov  5 22:31:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Nov  5 22:39:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has about 3000 active players
Tue Nov  5 22:40:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it had as many as 6000 at one point
Tue Nov  5 22:40:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:active, not online
Tue Nov  5 22:41:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that includes multiple chars

Tue Nov  5 22:42:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmmm. you would think so
Tue Nov  5 22:43:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the words 'psycho bitch' some to mind to me
Tue Nov  5 22:49:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:R'aaza don't pretend to udnerstand what he is talking about
Tue Nov  5 22:49:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wuld guess there is something funky about shadows in the parser
Tue Nov  5 22:50:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the exact error message?
Tue Nov  5 22:50:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:damn, R'aaza, some talking out your ass... it is not at all helpful to Crown

Tue Nov  5 22:53:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Crown: what was the exact error
Tue Nov  5 22:54:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, are you giving that obejct an environment?
Tue Nov  5 22:54:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is /realms/crown/starter?

Tue Nov  5 22:55:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you call ::create()?
Tue Nov  5 22:55:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:jinx
Tue Nov  5 23:00:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, but it has ot be locatedin /shadows
Tue Nov  5 23:01:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shadows are dangerous
Tue Nov  5 23:02:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM requires them to have reasonable security around them
Tue Nov  5 23:02:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that is why they get approved and put into /shadows :)
Tue Nov  5 23:03:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you let anyone code a shadow, they can do nasty things
Tue Nov  5 23:04:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:plus, there is no real use for shadows anyways

Thu Nov  7 18:50:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in NM IVr2.5 the mud doe snot use terminal_colour() yet to wrap
Thu Nov  7 21:08:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fucking homophobes
Thu Nov  7 21:09:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using it as a pejorative is
Thu Nov  7 21:10:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or are you too stupid to recognize that?

Thu Nov  7 21:26:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you probably don't know crap about it
Thu Nov  7 21:26:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, genius, what is crap about it?
Thu Nov  7 21:27:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is crap about it?
Thu Nov  7 21:27:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NOT
Thu Nov  7 21:28:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:J++ and VisualCafe are both very fast.. Netscape is slow
Thu Nov  7 21:28:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Netscape is licensing the VC JIT compiler, which means Netscape willbe just as fast in the next release
Thu Nov  7 21:29:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:has yet to see a real security hole since the last beta
Thu Nov  7 21:30:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, so you have top secet info?
Thu Nov  7 21:30:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:induction
Thu Nov  7 21:31:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you say that there are secret bugs, that suggests you know scret info
Thu Nov  7 21:31:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or that ou are making shit up
Thu Nov  7 21:32:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not know that languages got C2certification
Thu Nov  7 21:33:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Thu Nov  7 21:35:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just because you state there are security holes does not make it so
Thu Nov  7 21:36:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the dude says java sucks then cannot point to one concrete negative thing about it that sucks
Thu Nov  7 21:36:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you say it has security holes, but you cannot name one
Thu Nov  7 21:36:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the mean time, organizations all over the world are using it to build applications
Thu Nov  7 21:37:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what concrete things?
Thu Nov  7 21:37:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that it is slow? it is not
Thu Nov  7 21:37:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that ithas security holes? it has none
Thu Nov  7 21:37:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I don't run Linux
Thu Nov  7 21:38:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does 'figures' mean?
Thu Nov  7 21:39:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why does everyone cept me run Linux?
Thu Nov  7 22:24:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't do a clean upfor those
Thu Nov  7 22:24:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless I misunderstand you
Thu Nov  7 22:25:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudos does automatic garbage collection
Thu Nov  7 22:45:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I've got my orange crush
Thu Nov  7 22:47:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, you have already proven that you don't have anything in terms of ability to judge quality
Thu Nov  7 22:47:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:so I don't think REM should take offense
Thu Nov  7 22:52:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:DON'T USE add-action()
Thu Nov  7 22:53:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:then make a gargoyle selection
Thu Nov  7 22:54:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you specify that it was a player race?
Sat Nov  9 00:58:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:originally, the reaces wer enot put in because I had not yet done them
Sat Nov  9 00:58:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I am now of the belief having every mud come up with new races is a good hting
Sat Nov  9 00:59:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not likely, i do not remember anything about the guild object
Sat Nov  9 00:59:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what mraces list?
Sat Nov  9 00:59:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I intend to write a new guild object
Sat Nov  9 00:59:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Olgar: that is a v22b13 bug
Sat Nov  9 01:00:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it will be fixed with the next windows release

Sat Nov  9 01:02:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the www.imaginary.com pages have been undergoing serious modifications in the last week
Sat Nov  9 01:02:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:things may be out of order in places
Sat Nov  9 01:05:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Silvyar: no, I am waiting for 1 hour to myself
Sat Nov  9 01:05:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Olgar: the mudlib is OS independent
Sat Nov  9 01:05:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what matters is which version of NM you mix with which version of mudos
Sat Nov  9 01:05:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not which OS it runs on
Sat Nov  9 01:24:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:a number 1-5
Sat Nov  9 01:24:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it is just like skill class
Sat Nov  9 01:25:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:1 means iportant, 5, means unimportant
Sat Nov  9 01:27:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that your int is not considered amajor trait of your class
Sat Nov  9 01:28:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, it determines a lot of different things
Sat Nov  9 01:31:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the range is 1 to 5
Sat Nov  9 01:35:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is nothing magic about any number except 1, and only with classes
Sat Nov  9 01:35:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err skills
Sat Nov  9 01:35:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:points, level, and class are 3 different things
Sat Nov  9 01:36:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:level is what determines what you can orcannot do
Sat Nov  9 01:36:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:class determines how important the stat/skill is to you... how integral it is to your class/race
Sat Nov  9 01:36:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:points are a little internal exp counter
Sat Nov  9 01:37:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as NM ships, class for stats means nothing to players... just matters to NPC's in determining the auto-generation of stats
Sat Nov  9 01:37:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:class menaings for skills determines how fast they advance
Sat Nov  9 01:39:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too many questions none of which I understand :)
Sat Nov  9 01:41:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that depends on what you define in the config file for average stat
Sat Nov  9 01:41:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you define the avg as 90, then they will still have high speed
Sat Nov  9 01:42:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a 1 is more likely to greatly exceed the average than a 5
Sat Nov  9 01:44:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doing such is a massive mistake
Sat Nov  9 01:45:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no singular better way to throw the game out of balance
Sat Nov  9 10:32:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, that's bad
Sat Nov  9 10:33:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Beek is idle, Rust is not online, and it is sat morning
Sat Nov  9 10:34:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:faster? what sort of load of crap is that?
Sat Nov  9 10:40:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yo mama
Sat Nov  9 11:31:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably somehtign like GetlastEnvironment()
Sat Nov  9 11:31:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?
Sat Nov  9 11:32:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a hack for what?
Sat Nov  9 11:32:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it should not be used for that, no
Sat Nov  9 11:32:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are other uses foritthough
Sat Nov  9 11:33:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like a spell to send someone from whence they came
Sat Nov  9 11:33:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:override CanReceive()
Sat Nov  9 15:23:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am making a rather substantial license change to NM IVr5
Sat Nov  9 15:23:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can get a copy of the license at ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/LPC/lib/Nightmare/Agreement
Sat Nov  9 15:24:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is important for people who wish to upgrade :)
Sat Nov  9 15:24:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one would be, no
Sat Nov  9 15:25:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that does not have the parser stuff NM requires
Sat Nov  9 15:25:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to use the driver that ships with the mudlib or a later version
Sat Nov  9 15:26:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it comes with the driver
Sat Nov  9 15:26:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the installation of NM is as brain dead as it gets :)
Sat Nov  9 15:27:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want the UNIX version, you need UNIX
Sat Nov  9 15:27:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want the windows version, use windows
Sat Nov  9 15:28:36 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of the same version? they work the same
Sat Nov  9 15:30:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Sat Nov  9 16:01:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:intermud is foobar
Sat Nov  9 16:34:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare IVr5 is available now
Sat Nov  9 16:36:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a bug in your code
Sat Nov  9 16:37:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how is it failing?
Sat Nov  9 16:38:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, that is a bug with the smell stuyff... fixed in IVr5
Sat Nov  9 16:38:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, they ave the identity of a coprse after they are recognizable as such
Sat Nov  9 16:40:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea... upgrade to NM IV5 :)
Sat Nov  9 16:41:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr5 does have some small ncompatibilities
Sat Nov  9 16:42:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only if you coded stuff worngin thefirst place though
Sat Nov  9 16:43:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah,m it does
Sat Nov  9 16:46:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:who?
Sat Nov  9 17:56:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just in time for NM IVr5
Sat Nov  9 17:57:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where are they ont eh web?
Sat Nov  9 17:57:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, thanks :)
Sat Nov  9 17:58:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, will be releasded woith NMV
Sat Nov  9 17:59:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare has had zork stylke parsing for ages
Sat Nov  9 17:59:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Vengence: Nightmare does not have xp
Sat Nov  9 18:00:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare NM IVr2 is like a year and a halfold
Sat Nov  9 18:00:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which, I made add, has no purpose

Sat Nov  9 18:03:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:combat is not a client thing
Sat Nov  9 18:03:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:display of stuff is a client thing
Sat Nov  9 18:04:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right... that is a very fat client
Sat Nov  9 18:04:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the client hasno business doing client
Sat Nov  9 18:04:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err combat
Sat Nov  9 18:05:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the client is for the user to interface with the server
Sat Nov  9 18:05:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:its job is to display server information and route user input to the srver
Sat Nov  9 18:05:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would actually be a serious problem :)
Sat Nov  9 18:05:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would it be nat?
Sat Nov  9 18:06:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doing such would gain you absolutel ynothing
Sat Nov  9 18:06:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it would complicate your system
Sat Nov  9 18:07:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doing combat on the client wuld have ntohing to do with that
Sat Nov  9 18:08:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean the driver wouldno longer have to do its job? :)
Sat Nov  9 18:09:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the dirver's job is to do combat
Sat Nov  9 18:09:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at least, game modeling processing
Sat Nov  9 18:09:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define real timne combat?
Sat Nov  9 18:10:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM allows for that sort of thing
Sat Nov  9 18:10:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ha snothing to do with where you do the combat processing
Sat Nov  9 18:11:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does allow that though, if you change 1 or 2 lines of code
Sat Nov  9 18:12:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does not have that
Sat Nov  9 18:12:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:now you are talkintg about combat int different rooms, which is nothign youmentioned before
Sat Nov  9 18:12:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does not have you hit me/I hit you
Sat Nov  9 18:13:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that is a completely different concept... again one which has no bearing on where combat processing is done
Sat Nov  9 18:14:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ell, my point is that that IS the driver's job
Sat Nov  9 18:14:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is a template?
Sat Nov  9 18:14:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the driver is  just a programming language
Sat Nov  9 18:14:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, ther eis no such example
Sat Nov  9 18:15:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just look at what Set funcitons it has to offer
Sat Nov  9 18:16:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/include/lib.h
Sat Nov  9 18:16:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, good luck to ya
Sat Nov  9 18:18:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is probably not yet on the mirror sites
Sat Nov  9 18:18:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayuph
Sat Nov  9 18:19:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what was the problem with getting r4 working?

Sat Nov  9 18:22:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno... all I have left are documentation, v22, and examples
Sat Nov  9 18:23:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably also a few bugs will crop up that need fixing before the final release
Sat Nov  9 18:24:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:pretty much
Sat Nov  9 18:29:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has a sky which can contain ships
Sat Nov  9 18:29:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the sea I will build later in the month will just be an extension of that concept
Sat Nov  9 18:30:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, virtual rooms are for uncreative people

Sat Nov  9 19:00:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the rules for the parser
Sat Nov  9 19:00:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:set as many rules as you like
Sat Nov  9 19:01:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is no such thing as an action that applies to just oneobject
Sat Nov  9 19:04:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he should not
Sat Nov  9 19:04:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creators should be writing objects that respond to user input
Sat Nov  9 19:04:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib should determine what is valid userinput
Sat Nov  9 19:06:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:add_action() souldnot be used
Sat Nov  9 19:10:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm, why not give a cre write access to /lib?
Sat Nov  9 19:10:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:damn mudlib security
Sat Nov  9 19:12:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to learn to differentiate between sarcasm and an analogy
Sat Nov  9 19:12:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cusomized commands are nearly as bad as security violations
Sat Nov  9 19:12:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they degrade the uality of the mud
Sat Nov  9 19:13:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creators should not be randomly adding verbs
Sat Nov  9 19:13:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just like they should not be able to simply add their areas into the game
Sat Nov  9 19:14:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you completely miss the point
Sat Nov  9 19:14:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ever heard of quality control?
Sat Nov  9 19:15:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:guess what...
Sat Nov  9 19:16:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means your approval process has to test for the functionality of EVERY single command andmake sure that itis cnsistent with the way the same cmmands work on the rest of the mud
Sat Nov  9 19:16:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ian, take your insults somewhere else
Sat Nov  9 19:18:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there really is no need to add nw verbs randomly
Sat Nov  9 19:19:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are right... i am very defensive
Sat Nov  9 19:19:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:after 5 years of crap from idiotslikeoyu
Sat Nov  9 19:19:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Flood: like I said, there is absolutely no need to allow creators that
Sat Nov  9 19:20:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tell me one example of where a creator should have an action that is his alone
Sat Nov  9 19:21:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't think  the press stuff is working in IVr4
Sat Nov  9 19:21:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:upgrade to IVr5 for that
Sat Nov  9 19:21:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:100%
Sat Nov  9 19:22:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why is peer not a global vrb others can use?
Sat Nov  9 19:22:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, well, the example isold
Sat Nov  9 19:23:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there should be a join STR verb
Sat Nov  9 19:23:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so other rooms with similar needs can allow people to join things

Sat Nov  9 19:24:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not say itincreases security
Sat Nov  9 19:25:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the cre can write the verb and the admins can stick it in /verbs
Sat Nov  9 19:28:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not an old example... I am taking about LIB_PRESS
Sat Nov  9 19:29:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the obid is the words the user passed to identify ob
Sat Nov  9 19:30:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ian: because that creates a hodge podge of mixed syntaxes
Sat Nov  9 19:31:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have yet to provide an example of how they get in cres ways
Sat Nov  9 19:35:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:explain where that would be useful?
Sat Nov  9 19:37:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:open development != quality development
Sat Nov  9 19:39:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not quite
Sat Nov  9 19:39:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first off, I doubt Linux is built hap-hazard as you suggest
Sat Nov  9 19:39:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:open development isnot chaotic development
Sat Nov  9 19:39:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people just not randomly add libraries to Red hat Linux
Sat Nov  9 19:40:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is an open environment
Sat Nov  9 19:40:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what i am talking about is not closed development
Sat Nov  9 19:40:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what I am talking about is structured developmenbt
Sat Nov  9 19:42:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ian, can you do anything other thaninsultme?
Sat Nov  9 19:42:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at the context of the conversation
Sat Nov  9 19:43:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Flood, all i am saying is that open cmmand parsng is not more open, it is a recipe for poor quality
Sat Nov  9 19:44:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is it you want?
Sat Nov  9 19:44:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all opensyntax does is allow you to create inconsistent command parsing
Sat Nov  9 19:45:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the essence of what itis
Sat Nov  9 19:45:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Pearl
Sat Nov  9 19:45:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err no
Sat Nov  9 19:45:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you never get ars password can_*() they are all 0 except the string args
Sat Nov  9 19:47:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what events are for
Sat Nov  9 19:47:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the syntax ALWAYS should be controlled centrally
Sat Nov  9 19:47:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the opposite is by definition inconsistent cmmand parsing
Sat Nov  9 19:48:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM runs on events... the verbs define the command syntax, but objects define what happens
Sat Nov  9 19:48:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depends on the command
Sat Nov  9 19:48:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:have you read the verb parser page/
Sat Nov  9 19:52:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what Geldron?
Sat Nov  9 19:52:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:OBS for all
Sat Nov  9 19:53:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are extra args beyond those two
Sat Nov  9 19:53:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the third arg would be the id
Sat Nov  9 19:54:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the id being whatever the user typed
Sat Nov  9 21:02:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:2 seconds
Sun Nov 10 00:02:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably
Sun Nov 10 00:04:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr5 :) thanks :0
Sun Nov 10 00:08:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:to what end?
Sun Nov 10 00:18:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Nov 10 00:18:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the last beta before NM V
Sun Nov 10 00:21:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:local mods would be quite difficult
Sun Nov 10 00:21:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:combat.c was redone
Sun Nov 10 00:22:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not many
Sun Nov 10 00:39:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't write the driver
Sun Nov 10 00:49:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you need to create a desk dummy object
Sun Nov 10 00:49:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:have it inherit LIB-OPEN
Sun Nov 10 00:49:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ou should look at what du,mmy items are... they are new to IVr5
Sun Nov 10 00:49:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, lightweight object
Sun Nov 10 00:49:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all SetItems() are actually real objects now
Sun Nov 10 00:51:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is to make vehicle thigns like ships easier
Sun Nov 10 00:54:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is 100% backwards compat
Sun Nov 10 00:54:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with old items code
Sun Nov 10 00:54:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at README.txt for more info
Sun Nov 10 00:57:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sun Nov 10 00:58:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to both
Sun Nov 10 01:01:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i think it coudl be done more efficiently using mud mode
Sun Nov 10 01:11:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetCombatAction()
Sun Nov 10 01:13:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do whatever you want :)
Sun Nov 10 12:09:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not think so
Sun Nov 10 12:09:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be a NM thing though
Sun Nov 10 12:09:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just change /daemon/verbs.c
Sun Nov 10 12:23:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:to get a display name or unique identifier for command lines?
Sun Nov 10 12:23:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:GetName()
Sun Nov 10 12:24:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you need to call GetName() in the player
Sun Nov 10 12:25:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not if the this_player() is the monster
Sun Nov 10 12:26:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, it is the object isssuing the current ocmmand
Sun Nov 10 12:28:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you need a variable that points to theplayer
Sun Nov 10 12:29:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, ostensibly you have reason to believe there is a player in the room at the time you are saying somthing bad
Sun Nov 10 12:29:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:so probably that thing that triggers whatever you are doing passes you the player object
Sun Nov 10 12:33:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would likely be massive overkill too
Sun Nov 10 12:33:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lkike I said, something about the context of your call should tell you eactly what you want to know anmyways
Sun Nov 10 12:33:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably osmehting as simple as a SetEncounter() method
Sun Nov 10 12:34:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the method you set will be called whenever the NPOC encounters other beings
Sun Nov 10 12:35:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Nov 10 12:35:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this_player() is the prson executing the command
Sun Nov 10 12:36:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should pretty much never be using this_player() on a NM mudlib
Sun Nov 10 12:36:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NPCs still execute commands
Sun Nov 10 12:36:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this_player() does NOT mean a playr
Sun Nov 10 12:37:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your encounter function will pass the player being encountered as a variable
Sun Nov 10 12:38:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not SetEncounter()... you call SetEncounter() in your npc in the create() function to give it the name of a function to call when some living thing encounters it
Sun Nov 10 12:40:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it passes to your function an object that is the thing being encountered
Sun Nov 10 12:41:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where did you get that frm?
Sun Nov 10 12:41:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:from /doc/build/NPC:
Sun Nov 10 12:41:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mixed SetEncounter(mixed val);
Sun Nov 10 12:42:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it goes on to say that val can be a number, a funciton, or an array
Sun Nov 10 12:42:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then it says, whenever somethign encounters your monster, if the val was a function, that function gets called
Sun Nov 10 12:43:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the arg to that funciton is the object encountered
Sun Nov 10 12:45:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not going to tell you how to use it
Sun Nov 10 12:45:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do arg->eventDestruct() for all I care
Sun Nov 10 12:45:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can call it whatever tickles your fanbcy
Sun Nov 10 12:46:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reads the LPC manuals about functions, specifically what an argument to a function looks like as ell as a function definition
Sun Nov 10 12:52:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right, the input to your encounter function
Sun Nov 10 12:56:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't need to make SetEncounter() do anything
Sun Nov 10 12:57:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it passes the encountered thing
Sun Nov 10 12:57:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever calls it passes that variable
Sun Nov 10 12:57:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't need to worry abut that
Sun Nov 10 12:58:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where n the manuals did it say anything about functions asking for variables?>
Sun Nov 10 12:59:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, int myEncounter(object frigging_living_thing)
Sun Nov 10 12:59:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you think frigging_living_thing is?
Sun Nov 10 13:00:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bingo
Sun Nov 10 13:02:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not magic... it is THE VERY REASON your function isbeing called
Sun Nov 10 13:02:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetEncounter() gets called by you... it is designed to let the monster object know what happens when it encounters a living being
Sun Nov 10 13:03:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you call it whenever you want
Sun Nov 10 13:03:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you pass it a function, you are saying "when this monster encounters another living being, call my special function"
Sun Nov 10 13:04:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Sun Nov 10 13:05:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:word and string
Sun Nov 10 13:06:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's okay, I am told I have no patience :)
Sun Nov 10 13:06:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's English Geldron... one is a word, the other a string
Sun Nov 10 13:06:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one word, many words
Sun Nov 10 14:03:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:need to upgrade to NM IVr5
Sun Nov 10 14:03:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that was a bug in IVr4
Sun Nov 10 14:04:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should be able to... but because of a bug you cannot
Sun Nov 10 14:04:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what?
Sun Nov 10 14:05:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, at ftp.imaginary.com
Sun Nov 10 14:06:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is there
Sun Nov 10 14:07:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Sun Nov 10 15:37:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:edit /secure/cfg/groups.cfg like it says in the eb docs :)
Sun Nov 10 15:49:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means the player object no load
Sun Nov 10 15:50:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea, it depends what you did toit
Sun Nov 10 17:02:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is a docon the web
Sun Nov 10 17:05:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, a fixed NM IVr5 is available
Sun Nov 10 17:05:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a problem with help and npc.c
Sun Nov 10 17:06:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Sun Nov 10 17:07:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was not supposed tobe in the release.... itis NM LPMud only
Sun Nov 10 17:40:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would help if you were actually using his mudlib
Sun Nov 10 17:44:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lews: no
Sun Nov 10 17:44:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wrong mudlib
Sun Nov 10 20:08:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is non-beta some magic thign? :)
Sun Nov 10 20:09:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, NM IVr5 is the most bug-free one released
Sun Nov 10 20:09:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a missing }
Sun Nov 10 21:02:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such property
Sun Nov 10 21:03:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can save whatever object you like :)
Sun Nov 10 21:05:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Sun Nov 10 21:07:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know how to answer you
Sun Nov 10 21:08:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my guess is you did not get the side name right
Sun Nov 10 21:08:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like east, west
Sun Nov 10 21:10:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or whatever the fdirection is identifying it
Sun Nov 10 21:11:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you call SetDoor() in both rooms?
Sun Nov 10 21:13:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well it is a trapdoor
Sun Nov 10 22:05:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do a mudlist.... it is Lima :)
Sun Nov 10 22:32:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Nov 11 17:14:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sin(x)/cos(x) +5 - random(2)
Mon Nov 11 17:16:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:unfortunately, it is no longer in NM
Mon Nov 11 17:17:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:replaced it with sheer luck
Mon Nov 11 17:17:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:no, that is morality :)
Mon Nov 11 17:19:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:NM does attempt to determine if your act is malicious or self0-defense
Mon Nov 11 19:10:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:avoiding you
Mon Nov 11 19:35:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more people speak Klingon than esperanto
Mon Nov 11 19:35:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Joke... think a bit
Mon Nov 11 19:35:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he speaks german, it is 3am
Mon Nov 11 19:35:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more people speak Klingon :)
Mon Nov 11 19:36:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Nov 11 19:36:10 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:esperanto is a mde up lanuage
Mon Nov 11 19:36:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a bunch of geeks with way too much time on their hands made it up
Mon Nov 11 19:36:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and with a nasty bias towards romance languages
Mon Nov 11 19:37:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:j'en parle trois
Mon Nov 11 19:38:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are several celtic lanuages
Mon Nov 11 19:38:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I actually know a bit of gaelic and a bit of Irish
Mon Nov 11 19:38:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Briseann na fear cloiche ans an achadh
Mon Nov 11 19:39:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:be proud you started something with your ignorance
Mon Nov 11 19:40:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:evidentlly you did not hear him yelling at Ferris to stop speaking grman
Mon Nov 11 19:42:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:all the Celt languages are very close
Mon Nov 11 19:43:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:sounds like a personal problem Aslan
Mon Nov 11 19:54:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are elcome to do better Squidius
Mon Nov 11 19:56:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, Flood
Mon Nov 11 19:56:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I plan to whip something out in Java
Mon Nov 11 19:58:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the downside of Java?
Mon Nov 11 19:59:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:runs just as a fast on recent JIT compilers
Mon Nov 11 20:00:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:depends on the system
Mon Nov 11 20:00:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most implementations are just in time compilers
Mon Nov 11 20:00:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means the first tme througj, the instructions are p-code, the next time through mahcine code
Mon Nov 11 20:01:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not
Mon Nov 11 20:02:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Sun claims that JIT Java papplications will eventually run faster than native C++ apps
Mon Nov 11 20:04:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I work with Java day in and day out, and there is no speed problem compared to other RAD tools
Mon Nov 11 20:05:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it makes sense... down the road
Mon Nov 11 20:05:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not necessary? it is very necessary
Mon Nov 11 20:05:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it enables small-time developrs to compete with MS
Mon Nov 11 20:06:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wrong flood
Mon Nov 11 20:06:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it is limited to intel and requires distribution and installation, it does not do what java does
Mon Nov 11 20:07:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how?
Mon Nov 11 20:08:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not what enables people to go against MS and others
Mon Nov 11 20:08:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the ability to easily distroibute and get your code installed on most people's machines
Mon Nov 11 20:08:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:run Corel Office
Mon Nov 11 20:09:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Flood: very hard really
Mon Nov 11 20:09:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you always have people with problems installing the software
Mon Nov 11 20:09:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if you get into cmplex apps, there are a zillion potential problems you cannot foresee
Mon Nov 11 20:09:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is just one platform
Mon Nov 11 20:10:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks
Mon Nov 11 20:10:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:large companies are spending a hell of a lot of money on Java
Mon Nov 11 20:10:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Corel Office is in Java
Mon Nov 11 20:11:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so?
Mon Nov 11 20:12:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Symantec is doing fine
Mon Nov 11 20:12:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone I know o involved with Java is doing very well
Mon Nov 11 20:13:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I now alot of people involvd with jav
Mon Nov 11 20:13:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what sql java database thing?
Mon Nov 11 20:14:24 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SQL dead???
Mon Nov 11 20:14:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you think SQL is dead, you have your head up your ass
Mon Nov 11 20:14:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SQL and database talent are about the best paying things there are
Mon Nov 11 20:14:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what about dbanywhere?
Mon Nov 11 20:15:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:best selling?
Mon Nov 11 20:15:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:database vendors make a killing
Mon Nov 11 20:15:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you guys are completely clueless
Mon Nov 11 20:16:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because that is hat people will pay
Mon Nov 11 20:16:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hard core databases are EXTREMELY important to companies
Mon Nov 11 20:16:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:30 Oracle licenses sold last year? *laugh*
Mon Nov 11 20:17:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chapter 7 is personal bnkruptcy
Mon Nov 11 20:18:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:11 is corporate
Mon Nov 11 20:18:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yah
Mon Nov 11 20:18:39 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, Oracle is doing VERY well, and selling a lotmroe than 30 licenses a year
Mon Nov 11 20:19:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can probably count 30 licenses I know of in the last year
Mon Nov 11 20:20:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Iknow nothing about the web server
Mon Nov 11 20:20:08 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I dounbt that is doing very well
Mon Nov 11 20:20:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specially since oracle is now teaming with netscape
Mon Nov 11 20:20:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?
Mon Nov 11 20:20:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Oracle is the best DBMS out there rightnow
Mon Nov 11 20:21:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NS is not buying Oracle
Mon Nov 11 20:21:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are teamining up for web development
Mon Nov 11 20:22:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NS isnot putting into money so they stay alive
Mon Nov 11 20:22:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Oracle is makings its database work with NS server
Mon Nov 11 20:22:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know because it is my business to know
Mon Nov 11 20:23:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what???
Mon Nov 11 20:23:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever Ferris
Mon Nov 11 20:24:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, grmany is not oracle's base of operations
Mon Nov 11 20:24:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oracle is primarily a dfatabase evndor, and they make one hell of a lot of money off ofit
Mon Nov 11 20:28:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the ISP's I know here are doing very well
Mon Nov 11 20:30:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most ISP's only break even off of private customers
Mon Nov 11 20:30:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not where you makemoney as an ISP
Mon Nov 11 20:31:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no ISP trying to make money just does that
Mon Nov 11 20:31:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, for example I have a dedicated ISDN
Mon Nov 11 20:31:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they also do web site hosting, which is a lot of money with no resource costs
Mon Nov 11 20:39:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, paying $200/month makes me expect immediate service
Mon Nov 11 20:39:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I always get excellent service form my ISP
Mon Nov 11 20:39:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:but my point being is that dedicated cutomers expect more
Mon Nov 11 20:41:58 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:I know that each and every time my ISDN goes down I am calling them up within 1 minute of it going down
Mon Nov 11 20:43:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:your telco is evidently not US west
Mon Nov 11 20:44:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:the worst one I have ever seen
Mon Nov 11 20:44:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:one time I called them up about something stupid they did
Mon Nov 11 20:44:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:got piushed frm person to person
Mon Nov 11 20:44:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:finally told the last person I spoke to that theminute AT&T is offering local service, I am gone
Mon Nov 11 20:44:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:they said they wuld be right behind me
Mon Nov 11 20:45:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:their own people think they suck
Mon Nov 11 20:45:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:a lot of the long distances carries will soon
Mon Nov 11 20:49:53 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the HTML to change font colour?
Mon Nov 11 21:02:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is there a directive to return to the default colour in HTML?
Mon Nov 11 22:43:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:localcmds is no longer a useful command
Mon Nov 11 22:44:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:because there are no such things as local commands
Mon Nov 11 22:45:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes Nippie
Mon Nov 11 22:45:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:open and close are not local commands
Mon Nov 11 22:47:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that foundation? oh
Mon Nov 11 22:47:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, I honestly don't know how doos on foundation work
Mon Nov 11 22:47:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are running NM V
Mon Nov 11 22:47:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:6 will actually likely be compatible
Mon Nov 11 22:48:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:forcing on everyone else?
Mon Nov 11 22:48:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one is stopping you from writing your own mudlib
Mon Nov 11 22:48:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or are you suggesting we code into ur mudlibs what we think are bad ideas?
Mon Nov 11 22:49:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no it doesnot
Mon Nov 11 22:49:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it says NM IVr5
Mon Nov 11 22:49:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is the fifth beta for NM V
Mon Nov 11 22:49:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it hapopens to have that wel documented
Mon Nov 11 22:51:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is a page detailing exactly what a NM releasemeans
Mon Nov 11 22:51:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it ain't rocket science
Mon Nov 11 22:52:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the one on versions
Mon Nov 11 22:53:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to an extreme
Mon Nov 11 22:55:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Versions.html
Mon Nov 11 22:56:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:very out of date with respect to what the current release is, but completely correct as far as the topic goes
Mon Nov 11 22:57:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:VVVVVVVVV
Mon Nov 11 22:57:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it says the full release is not far away
Mon Nov 11 22:58:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:read the web page
Mon Nov 11 23:00:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:70% of what listed says IV because 4.* are betas leading up to 5
Mon Nov 11 23:00:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the full release of 5 is not yet available
Mon Nov 11 23:00:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but everything out right now is for 5
Mon Nov 11 23:00:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we use english differently?
Mon Nov 11 23:01:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the versions page explaines just what I said
Mon Nov 11 23:01:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you read the versioning page?
Mon Nov 11 23:02:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not the versioning page
Mon Nov 11 23:02:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare V is the full release
Mon Nov 11 23:03:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:current development is not dar away
Mon Nov 11 23:03:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never said versions.html
Mon Nov 11 23:03:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said Versions.html
Mon Nov 11 23:04:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I had one
Mon Nov 11 23:04:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno what happened
Mon Nov 11 23:04:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am redoing the entire web site htis weekend anyways
Mon Nov 11 23:05:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the final bit for the final release is documentation
Mon Nov 11 23:05:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java rocks
Mon Nov 11 23:05:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:good night :)
Mon Nov 11 23:11:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:btw... visit the NM LPMud homepage at http://www.imaginary.com/LPMud/Nightmare    we been changign those big time :)
Tue Nov 12 18:26:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no add_action()
Tue Nov 12 19:11:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:it automatically connects to intermud
Tue Nov 12 19:21:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, never use catch_tell()
Tue Nov 12 19:21:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:use eventPrint()
Tue Nov 12 19:22:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:no, becuase those arenot relevent to the room
Tue Nov 12 19:22:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:only living things in the room hear talk
Tue Nov 12 19:26:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:yes
Tue Nov 12 20:34:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:expect a mudlib? :)
Tue Nov 12 20:36:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:well, please explain how I could possibly answer that question in any other way
Wed Nov 13 07:59:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:never use catch_tell() with NM
Wed Nov 13 08:01:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because that is not the way it is done
Wed Nov 13 08:02:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what sort of event?
Wed Nov 13 08:03:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the room knows when someone leaves something in it via eventPrint()
Wed Nov 13 08:03:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it makes absolutely no sense for a non-living thing to respond to talk
Wed Nov 13 08:04:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a magical weapon is not alive
Wed Nov 13 08:05:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what languages does it understand?
Wed Nov 13 08:05:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:getting it to happen in the lib is no problem
Wed Nov 13 08:05:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO it is a lot of extra processing for something that would never happen
Wed Nov 13 08:07:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to disagee with me and implement the talk stuff in rooms and inanimate objects
Wed Nov 13 08:07:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wanting to do that is not stupid
Wed Nov 13 08:08:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what I am saying is that for the mudlib, that means sending everything to every object
Wed Nov 13 08:08:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no add_action() in NM Chewy
Wed Nov 13 08:09:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so that means for all the talking going on all the time, you have a bunch of stuff being sent to stuff that almost never happens
Wed Nov 13 08:09:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Chewy no one here has that old thing except you :)
Wed Nov 13 08:09:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and 4 is nothing like 3
Wed Nov 13 08:14:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:biorhythms give people daily fluctiation in their abilities
Wed Nov 13 08:15:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in other words, up days, average days, and down days
Wed Nov 13 08:15:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not about bad hair days
Wed Nov 13 08:18:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, arr = map(allocate(sizeof(arr)), (: 2 :))
Wed Nov 13 18:12:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:foundation does not uuse the parser
Wed Nov 13 18:37:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't
Wed Nov 13 18:37:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you make objects respond to existing commands
Wed Nov 13 18:37:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and do not use add_action() ever
Wed Nov 13 18:39:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is /lib/press for handling respoinses to the press command
Wed Nov 13 18:40:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be misusing your mudlib
Wed Nov 13 18:40:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to give everyone write access to your computer too, but it is not recommended
Wed Nov 13 18:42:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it has not ben converted yet
Wed Nov 13 18:42:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the only reason add_action() does not produce an error
Wed Nov 13 18:43:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is also the problem that a lot is tied into NO_ADD-ACTION besides commands
Wed Nov 13 18:46:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you were not the one asking the question pearl
Wed Nov 13 18:46:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the answer to your question is you destruced an object in an add action that returned 0
Wed Nov 13 18:48:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the question about verbs had nothing to do with your questioon
Wed Nov 13 18:51:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes
Wed Nov 13 18:52:07 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:learn the locate command
Wed Nov 13 18:55:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you updated the door, but not he room you are in
Wed Nov 13 18:55:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:doors are not supposed to be updated
Wed Nov 13 18:56:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you can, but you have to update each room afterwards
Wed Nov 13 18:56:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:doors are shared objecys
Wed Nov 13 19:20:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IP router???
Wed Nov 13 20:53:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means you did not call ::create()
Thu Nov 14 17:15:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot
Thu Nov 14 17:15:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Nov 14 17:15:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not allow people to use it any more
Thu Nov 14 17:16:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where can you get one?
Thu Nov 14 17:16:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that mud would have been started when I allowed people to use NM 3
Thu Nov 14 17:17:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a lot of older muds run it
Thu Nov 14 17:17:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot download it to start a new mud
Thu Nov 14 17:20:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is Discworld under a different name
Thu Nov 14 17:21:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:boggle
Thu Nov 14 17:21:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know all NM and Foundation compile with Solaris
Thu Nov 14 17:21:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the only OS on which they have been tested
Thu Nov 14 17:21:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ys Flood, otherwise they would not be lower case
Thu Nov 14 17:22:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:athens.imaginary.com is a Solaris site
Thu Nov 14 17:22:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM IVr5 I know compiles for solaris straight out of the box with no problems
Thu Nov 14 17:24:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr5 is in much better shape than Foudnation
Thu Nov 14 17:24:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially if you do not want to code your own user object
Thu Nov 14 17:24:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those applies are not guaranteed to be called in any order at any point
Thu Nov 14 17:24:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the parser calls them when it needs to find out that info about an object
Thu Nov 14 17:27:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define accessible?
Thu Nov 14 17:27:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it needs to be visible tobe considered even
Thu Nov 14 17:28:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not really sure of the practical difference between inventory_accessible() and inventory_visible()
Thu Nov 14 17:28:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since the parser has no concept of a difference between viewing something and actingon it
Thu Nov 14 17:31:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange::v?
Thu Nov 14 17:31:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is :v?
Thu Nov 14 17:34:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that gives me something to do for look at OBJ in OBJ :)
Thu Nov 14 17:36:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, I have a question about those...
Thu Nov 14 17:36:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:visible and accessible to whom?
Thu Nov 14 17:37:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in other words, if I have a sword inside a clear chest that is closed
Thu Nov 14 17:37:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that sword is visible, but not accessible to people outside the chest
Thu Nov 14 17:37:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course, it is accessible to anyone who might happen to be in the chest
Thu Nov 14 17:39:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek?
Thu Nov 14 17:40:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:never mind
Thu Nov 14 17:41:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for somereason I was think the accessible stuff was an item modifier
Thu Nov 14 17:42:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:instead of a container example
Thu Nov 14 17:51:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe should have a must not be living midifier
Thu Nov 14 17:53:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well... it was not consistency so much as why should I put a indirect_look_at_obj_in_obj() in living.c when it is completely not involved
Thu Nov 14 17:55:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i would agree with that argument
Thu Nov 14 19:21:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:wherever you are morphing it, you just call SetLong() again like you did in create()
Thu Nov 14 19:22:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am rewriting them
Thu Nov 14 19:22:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what problem are you having right now?
Thu Nov 14 19:23:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:things will be changing very heavily between now and NM V
Thu Nov 14 19:31:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, you were right the first time
Thu Nov 14 19:31:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:STR rules are the last toi be matched
Thu Nov 14 19:32:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they should be avoided unless nothing else fits
Thu Nov 14 22:01:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it takes a long time if you are slow
Thu Nov 14 22:02:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people complaining about the speed of combat
Thu Nov 14 22:03:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the speed of combat depends on the speed stat of the combatant
Thu Nov 14 22:10:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't let the object count if it is in another player's inventory
Thu Nov 14 22:11:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Thu Nov 14 22:12:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you are probably not returning a string beginning iwth #
Thu Nov 14 22:13:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:return "#You don't have that."
Thu Nov 14 22:19:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know
Thu Nov 14 22:37:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is thre HTML FONT attribute to indicate you want the text font size to be smaller?
Thu Nov 14 22:37:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno, I will try :)
Thu Nov 14 22:51:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it already exists
Thu Nov 14 22:56:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you need to design an invis system
Thu Nov 14 22:56:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:invis is a very non-trivial concept, and I have never seen it done right
Fri Nov 15 07:13:57 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sleepy is a better word
Fri Nov 15 07:24:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the guild objects sucks and should be redone... the NPC leaders are rather simple and don't involve much advice
Fri Nov 15 07:24:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that guild object does not allow for NPC leadersof guilds
Fri Nov 15 07:24:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the leader must be a player
Fri Nov 15 07:29:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, a PLAYER is a guild leader
Fri Nov 15 07:31:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's the idea
Fri Nov 15 07:33:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't do it here
Fri Nov 15 16:24:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bang
Fri Nov 15 16:34:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is meaningless
Fri Nov 15 16:51:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what did you change?.
Fri Nov 15 17:11:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, mudos win32 does not come with IVr5 :)
Fri Nov 15 17:16:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Fri Nov 15 18:59:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetCombatAction()
Fri Nov 15 18:59:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetAttack() can also be used, but SetCombatAction() is more specific
Fri Nov 15 22:04:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am here
Fri Nov 15 22:05:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does not matter one bit
Fri Nov 15 22:05:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless some of them inherit each other
Fri Nov 15 22:10:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:me
Fri Nov 15 22:10:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless Kal rewrote it
Fri Nov 15 22:12:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course I would include it there
Fri Nov 15 22:16:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, please look at the new web pages for NM and give any feedbackon the initial layout please :)
Fri Nov 15 22:31:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how would you even have gotten to that?
Fri Nov 15 22:31:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no links toit
Fri Nov 15 22:33:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:notyet
Fri Nov 15 22:34:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes
Fri Nov 15 23:46:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM IVr5 is not bugged
Fri Nov 15 23:47:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the pronblem is that you need to go and edit your network.h and point it to the intermud router
Fri Nov 15 23:47:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and edit config.h amd change your FILL IN THE BLANK
Sat Nov 16 00:33:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:inline???
Sat Nov 16 18:05:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:send_messages()
Sat Nov 16 18:05:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and dest does that destreuct() hocus pocus because it has special perms to do so
Sat Nov 16 18:05:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Sat Nov 16 18:06:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sorry about that :)
Sat Nov 16 18:13:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sat Nov 16 19:39:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the cheeseemud folk are full of shit and don't know what they are talking about
Sat Nov 16 19:40:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to get help working with win32 mudos: midir /cmds/common and /secure/cmds/common
Sat Nov 16 19:41:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and exactly which editor do you man?
Sat Nov 16 19:42:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:from what mudlib?
Sat Nov 16 19:42:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it works fine
Sat Nov 16 19:42:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am right now
Sat Nov 16 19:43:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me guess... you decided to arbitrarily use some mudos driver rather than following theinstallation instructions?
Sat Nov 16 19:44:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no amount of bullshit is going to change the fact that you fucked up :)
Sat Nov 16 19:46:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the driver... liek I said, follow the installation instructionsand you will not have any trouble
Sat Nov 16 19:47:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not say that... I said you should follow the directions
Sat Nov 16 19:48:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hint: you need to us the Foundation installation utility that compiles the driver for you
Sat Nov 16 20:27:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Sat Nov 16 20:30:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is also something in there like Install.txt or something that says run Configure
Sat Nov 16 20:32:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I forget exactly where, but just type Configure
Sat Nov 16 20:34:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so?
Sat Nov 16 20:34:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which command?
Sat Nov 16 20:35:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Documentation/Install.html
Sat Nov 16 20:44:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what a wizardsa file is
Sat Nov 16 20:47:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it is a simple define in dirs.h
Sat Nov 16 20:47:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that means you can't have players be wizards
Sat Nov 16 20:49:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is why NM uses the term creators and not wizards :)
Sat Nov 16 20:50:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is a 'wizard'?
Sat Nov 16 22:54:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Nov 16 22:55:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they work :)
Sat Nov 16 22:55:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though climbs work a lot differently... check the release notes
Sat Nov 16 22:56:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:touch works just like smells, listens, etc
Sat Nov 16 22:57:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:climb is done by creating a fence object (for example) and having that object inherit from LIB_CLIMB
Sat Nov 16 22:58:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, like an object in the room
Sat Nov 16 22:59:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Nov 16 23:02:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, c'est la view
Sat Nov 16 23:05:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Sat Nov 16 23:07:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:please explain to me how brownie points work
Sat Nov 16 23:10:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Nov 16 23:10:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, yes and no
Sat Nov 16 23:10:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that depends, where are you inheriting LIB_CLIMB?
Sat Nov 16 23:11:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I said put it in a separate object
Sat Nov 16 23:12:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:an object in the room
Sat Nov 16 23:14:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:take it to intergossip
Sat Nov 16 23:16:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:either a real object, or better a dummy  item object
Sat Nov 16 23:38:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Sat Nov 16 23:40:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:WHAT?
Sat Nov 16 23:42:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not pointing to the intermud server
Sat Nov 16 23:43:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:editing /secure/include/network.h or some such file and pointing it to the righty IP
Sat Nov 16 23:43:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sat Nov 16 23:45:31 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a nameserver?
Sat Nov 16 23:46:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the one and onlyintermud router
Sat Nov 16 23:46:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if that is whart is already there, then no
Sat Nov 16 23:47:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nm has a wrong value
Sat Nov 16 23:48:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or check the intermud docs
Sat Nov 16 23:51:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I already said I do not know :)
Sat Nov 16 23:56:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you get theintermud router IP
Sat Nov 16 23:56:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you oculd probably get it from your /save/intermud.o
Sat Nov 16 23:58:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/daemon/include?
Sat Nov 16 23:58:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don';t have the right address in here
Sat Nov 16 23:58:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:206.151.209.131
Sat Nov 16 23:59:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I don't need the right address
Sat Nov 16 23:59:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the old router at that address I have told me where to go
Sat Nov 16 23:59:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud is smart like that
Sun Nov 17 00:03:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like, why on earth ould you do that?
Sun Nov 17 00:04:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/secure/cfg/preload.cfg
Sun Nov 17 00:28:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, that depends on your mudos release :)
Sun Nov 17 00:28:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is why lima does that
Sun Nov 17 00:28:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does that too
Sun Nov 17 00:29:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those functions have been messed up so much over time, our mudlibs protect ourselves against chanbges
Sun Nov 17 00:29:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh
Sun Nov 17 00:29:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it should do if( str[0] != '/' ) str = "/" + str;
Sun Nov 17 00:30:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sun Nov 17 00:57:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would love to get some feedback on the layout of the NM V documentation... it is not all done, but the layout is there at http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare
Sun Nov 17 01:16:41 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Light is all that is done for the building section right now
Sun Nov 17 01:16:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:working on rooms
Sun Nov 17 01:17:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Sun Nov 17 11:00:50 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do so many peopl out there fail to use modern browsers when they know most web sites use modern browserds? :)
Sun Nov 17 11:01:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a 486 is too much for you?
Sun Nov 17 11:02:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, that does sound like a personal problem :)
Sun Nov 17 11:05:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too bad you guys don't have 3 pentiums, the smallest of which has 32 MB, and two of which are laptops connected via ISDN :)
Sun Nov 17 11:06:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sure
Sun Nov 17 11:06:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:see if you can stick them in incoming
Sun Nov 17 11:06:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with a readme describing them
Sun Nov 17 12:09:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't tell us, mail mudos-bugs@imaginary.com
Sun Nov 17 13:46:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:copy over your old intermud.o file
Sun Nov 17 13:46:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:uh-huh
Sun Nov 17 15:44:09 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:strip out the overhead from a tmi-2 mud...
Sun Nov 17 15:44:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that one is too easy
Sun Nov 17 15:49:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no such file
Sun Nov 17 15:50:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea about FIIr1
Sun Nov 17 18:46:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:learn locate
Sun Nov 17 18:55:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is something you created when your driver crashed
Sun Nov 17 18:56:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Nov 17 18:57:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thank you :)
Sun Nov 17 19:00:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea... the Ylsrim domain is not really there for anything in the IVr5 release
Sun Nov 17 20:11:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:MudOS/NM compiles without trouble on solaris
Sun Nov 17 20:29:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:why would it?
Sun Nov 17 20:29:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:suggestion: read your documentation
Sun Nov 17 20:30:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the question?
Sun Nov 17 20:31:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, dune, the answer to your quesiton is encre
Sun Nov 17 20:31:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and better answer, read the docs
Sun Nov 17 20:31:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am asking what is the other wquesiton
Sun Nov 17 20:48:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean change?
Sun Nov 17 20:52:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yopu editit, and change it
Sun Nov 17 23:46:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM had a full screen area builder along time ahor
Sun Nov 17 23:47:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, before that
Sun Nov 17 23:51:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any java applet can easily be written as an application too
Sun Nov 17 23:52:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I believe there is now a win16 VM
Mon Nov 18 08:11:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not to my knowledge
Mon Nov 18 08:12:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:why do you want a DEC UNIX? :)
Mon Nov 18 08:13:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:well, no, I don't know of any such thing
Mon Nov 18 17:53:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is very bad code
Mon Nov 18 17:53:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the proper way is to o\extend the eventHearTalk() method
Mon Nov 18 17:53:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or, if you have a sentient, use SetTalkResponses() :)
Mon Nov 18 17:54:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:more right than what i said, and I coded it :)
Mon Nov 18 17:54:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, how many amulets are listening to you talk?
Mon Nov 18 17:55:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:listening to people is not something amulets do
Mon Nov 18 17:56:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM could have ben coded otherwise.... bvut that means every message gets sent to dozens of objects that could care less to support your one rogue amulet :)
Mon Nov 18 17:56:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO, not worth the CPU
Mon Nov 18 17:57:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/doc maybe
Mon Nov 18 17:57:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only way to do what you want is to change the paradigm or shadow the user
Mon Nov 18 17:58:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Nov 18 17:59:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Nov 18 17:59:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:non-living things do not hear chat
Mon Nov 18 18:01:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, the documentation is in /secure/cfg/races
Mon Nov 18 19:27:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the race needs to be in /secure/cfg/races
Mon Nov 18 19:29:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, GetEffectiveVision(), see the lighting document on the web pages
Mon Nov 18 19:29:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Mon Nov 18 19:29:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any insivisbility support is up to you
Mon Nov 18 19:30:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:GetEffectiveVision() determines you ability to see
Mon Nov 18 19:31:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, your ability to see in a given situation
Mon Nov 18 19:35:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:take a look at the NM stuff
Mon Nov 18 19:35:56 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does a lot of stuff global like that, not just for looking at, but also for lighting purposes and such
Mon Nov 18 19:37:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can login to DS
Mon Nov 18 19:59:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mudservices.com ticks me of :)
Mon Nov 18 19:59:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I had the money right now, I would get another machine just to undercut their prices
Mon Nov 18 20:03:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:copy over your old intermud.o
Mon Nov 18 21:14:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone here use Visual C++?
Mon Nov 18 21:20:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:nilla wafers and root beer
Mon Nov 18 21:43:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who the duck are you?

Mon Nov 18 21:53:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:asmodai, fuck off
Mon Nov 18 21:54:13 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people from your little two bit copy mud should crawl back into your hole
Mon Nov 18 22:06:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:"pretitle $N title"
Mon Nov 18 22:08:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err actually it would not
Mon Nov 18 22:08:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such thing as a pretitle
Mon Nov 18 22:08:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:pretitle is automatically newbie or hight mortal
Mon Nov 18 22:08:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you are not a player
Mon Nov 18 22:09:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sure there is
Mon Nov 18 22:09:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at GetShort()
Mon Nov 18 22:14:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is everyone's favourite windows email system? win95/NYT please
Mon Nov 18 22:15:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:netscape does not route mail for you
Mon Nov 18 22:15:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:MS exchange sucks big time
Mon Nov 18 22:16:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:will it route different types of mail to different folders based on rules?
Mon Nov 18 22:17:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:now that is a plus :)
Mon Nov 18 22:17:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where do you get it? do you remember?
Mon Nov 18 22:21:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I love ISDN :)
Mon Nov 18 22:22:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not Tisco :)
Mon Nov 18 22:23:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ISDN is faster
Tue Nov 19 08:34:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any questions?
Tue Nov 19 08:36:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is intercre, not intergossipp
Tue Nov 19 17:43:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use tell
Tue Nov 19 17:43:37 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't need to leave out the -
Tue Nov 19 17:44:03 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be me
Tue Nov 19 17:45:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I get paid money for my 'little java projects' :)
Tue Nov 19 17:45:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are going well to :)
Tue Nov 19 18:03:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because stamina points is a float value
Tue Nov 19 18:08:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because stamina is deducted every move
Tue Nov 19 18:10:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't think so
Tue Nov 19 20:35:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you can do that
Tue Nov 19 20:43:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I downloaded it, have not installed it yet
Tue Nov 19 20:59:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Tue Nov 19 20:59:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it is the proper way to do call outs
Tue Nov 19 20:59:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Nov 19 21:23:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Dead Souls:Kalinash uses Internet Explorer!!! Everyone make fun of him and call him names
Tue Nov 19 21:27:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am using NM V
Tue Nov 19 21:27:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is fixed for NM V
Tue Nov 19 21:28:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, it should not happen even in IV
Tue Nov 19 21:28:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:are you setting multiple id's for the door?
Tue Nov 19 22:08:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is automatic
Tue Nov 19 22:08:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your NPC was not setup with wielding paws
Tue Nov 19 22:08:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no SetWieldingLimbs(0
Tue Nov 19 22:09:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:edit the griffin race file so it can wield in paws
Tue Nov 19 22:11:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what?
Tue Nov 19 22:12:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you get a headache, just lop off your head
Tue Nov 19 22:12:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you got that insane idea from where?
Tue Nov 19 22:14:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:help is not working becausre you deleted the help object
Tue Nov 19 22:15:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I seriously doubt that help is working at all if you deleted the help files
Tue Nov 19 22:16:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am certain it is not working
Tue Nov 19 22:20:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, well, how did you get help.c files in those locations?
Tue Nov 19 22:20:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the help file is in /verbs/common
Tue Nov 19 22:20:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are there in the LATEST releases
Tue Nov 19 22:20:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not in your release
Tue Nov 19 22:22:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I would bet you did not follow the directions
Tue Nov 19 22:26:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you said NM IVr5
Tue Nov 19 22:27:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where did you get NM IVr2.5?
Tue Nov 19 22:32:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not publically available I hope
Tue Nov 19 22:32:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:file_exists() is not an efun, it is an sefun
Tue Nov 19 22:43:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a lot
Tue Nov 19 22:43:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and because I control the avilability of NM
Tue Nov 19 23:10:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:weapons are wielded in whatevr limbs you set them to be wielded in
Tue Nov 19 23:11:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the race file
Wed Nov 20 20:07:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the NM site
Wed Nov 20 20:08:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is because they are not done
Wed Nov 20 20:08:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just started writing them this past weekend
Wed Nov 20 20:09:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the text docs are old and likely wrong
Wed Nov 20 20:10:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, DB, I want to create a /protocols dir and move the intermud3 doc there (with a link from the old spot)... any objectsions?
Wed Nov 20 20:12:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:depends on how you code it
Wed Nov 20 20:13:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:without SetPath(), no
Wed Nov 20 20:15:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you not want to use SetPath()?
Wed Nov 20 20:15:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by definition, if you care where it goes, you use SetPath()
Wed Nov 20 20:15:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you do not, then you do not
Wed Nov 20 20:16:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can have the driver do whatever you like :)
Wed Nov 20 20:16:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, SetPath() does that
Wed Nov 20 20:17:07 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does haphazardly mean?
Wed Nov 20 20:17:33 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is so important about perfect randomness?
Wed Nov 20 20:17:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want to control the path, you use SetPath()
Wed Nov 20 20:17:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not using SetPath() does not get you any greatr apperance of wandering
Wed Nov 20 20:18:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this_player() is whoever is executing the command
Wed Nov 20 20:19:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Wed Nov 20 20:36:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at the info in /secure/cfg/classes
Wed Nov 20 20:38:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such thing as a 'standard' skill
Wed Nov 20 20:40:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those that are on the mud are those that you define for a class
Wed Nov 20 20:42:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:notice: I am working on creating a solid RCP protocol, the start of the protocol is at http://www.imaginary.com/protocols/RCP.html
Wed Nov 20 20:42:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wherever you write stuff requiring breathingwater
Wed Nov 20 20:42:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is not really a skill, it would properly be a stat
Wed Nov 20 21:58:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I might be
Wed Nov 20 23:02:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?

Wed Nov 20 23:07:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the docs said nothing about that...
Wed Nov 20 23:08:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everything you should keep in mind is on the web page for the release
Wed Nov 20 23:08:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it was exhaustive to begin with
Wed Nov 20 23:09:11 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so no one has driven one?
Wed Nov 20 23:10:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes we are... if we had an answer we would say so
Wed Nov 20 23:10:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?

Wed Nov 20 23:15:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ugh... we certainly do not have enough involvement to start an intercar channel
Wed Nov 20 23:15:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no :(
Wed Nov 20 23:16:05 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you people drive?
Wed Nov 20 23:18:38 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so NO ONE has a car they would recommend?
Wed Nov 20 23:19:02 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know nothing about that car
Wed Nov 20 23:21:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, at least i got web trends working for www.imaginary.cm
Wed Nov 20 23:21:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one uses Internet Explorer! :)

Thu Nov 21 20:03:45 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is up with intermud?
Thu Nov 21 20:24:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Dead Souls:there is no problem with SetOItems()

Thu Nov 21 23:11:34 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:I had to comment out a standard MFC header define to get it to work
Thu Nov 21 23:12:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:that would be understandable if it were a linkinbg problem
Thu Nov 21 23:12:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Win95 Test:it was a compile problem
Fri Nov 22 07:30:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Heaven 7 rocks!

Fri Nov 22 17:40:15 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:time to go see star trek :)
Fri Nov 22 21:33:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:good movie
Fri Nov 22 22:33:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try looking at the directory structure documentation on the NM site :)
Fri Nov 22 22:34:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no add action examples
Fri Nov 22 22:35:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:add action is not used on NM muds
Fri Nov 22 22:36:01 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the key name
Fri Nov 22 22:36:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it returns a unique identifuer for that player
Fri Nov 22 22:36:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should never use it in any other context, nor should you count on it having any proeerty other than being unique
Fri Nov 22 22:37:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in other words, it so happens that key names are lower case... but that is not their function
Fri Nov 22 22:37:59 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever it is in the lib :)
Fri Nov 22 22:38:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably MSG_SYSTEM
Fri Nov 22 22:38:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not really important with the login object
Fri Nov 22 22:38:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the login object does not do any bizarre filtering
Fri Nov 22 22:39:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be foolish
Fri Nov 22 22:39:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless you totally rewrite the way it works
Fri Nov 22 22:39:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because at the time of initial login, you know nothing about the user's terminal type
Fri Nov 22 22:39:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why prompt for term? most people have no idea what that means
Fri Nov 22 22:40:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and telnet tells you anyways
Fri Nov 22 22:40:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't... NM already does it for you
Fri Nov 22 22:42:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you mess up a lot of people's screens
Fri Nov 22 22:43:21 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a program asking me term type info is a major pet peeve of mine
Fri Nov 22 22:43:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can do a colour login, as i said earlier
Fri Nov 22 22:44:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you have to totally change the way you do things
Fri Nov 22 22:44:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, you sit around and wait for the terminal information to arrive
Fri Nov 22 22:45:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO, not worth the troulble for a few extra colours in a login screen
Fri Nov 22 22:46:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially since NM will have agif login screen in a few months :)
Sat Nov 23 09:40:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:getuid() is not available on NBM muds (thank god)
Sat Nov 23 09:40:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM
Sat Nov 23 09:41:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a dedicated sparc 20 is a good thing
Sat Nov 23 17:12:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you do not modify the NM configuation file
Sat Nov 23 17:13:41 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what a smart guy!
Sat Nov 23 17:21:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Nov 23 17:21:13 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it pops it onto the stack for the next round of callouts
Sat Nov 23 17:21:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning other fnctions could and probably are executed between
Sat Nov 23 17:28:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what should their proper mass be?
Sat Nov 23 17:29:34 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you arrive at 1 as the proper mass?
Sat Nov 23 17:30:30 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mass of a container is not equal to the sum of its contents'
Sat Nov 23 17:30:44 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:otherwise there would be no point to carrying a container object
Sat Nov 23 17:33:11 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it may not be missing it
Sat Nov 23 17:33:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chance are that your 'fix' messed it up
Sat Nov 23 17:34:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would not be correct... that mechanism works fine on ZNM
Sat Nov 23 18:37:17 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how would I get a list of all files in one dir which differ from files of the same name in a different dir?
Sat Nov 23 18:38:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in anything
Sat Nov 23 18:41:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as in anything that will do the trick
Sat Nov 23 18:43:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Silvyar, of course
Sat Nov 23 18:43:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Flood I am on any system I want
Sat Nov 23 18:44:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:set what lower?
Sat Nov 23 18:44:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can set a casp on number of bboard posts
Sat Nov 23 18:46:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the bboard is a non-supported feature of the mudlib
Sat Nov 23 18:47:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning I do not remember how it works and I would just as soon write a new one before looking up how it works
Sat Nov 23 18:47:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, you are meant to write your own bboard system
Sat Nov 23 18:49:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is in fact a mudlib thing
Sat Nov 23 18:49:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but one I have chosen to put off for NM VI
Sat Nov 23 18:49:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for the reason that it is a very blatant UI feature
Sat Nov 23 18:49:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and VI is about enhancing the UI
Sat Nov 23 18:51:51 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it just happened to be in there
Sat Nov 23 18:51:57 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can delete it
Sat Nov 23 19:31:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shut the ufck up ferris
Sat Nov 23 19:32:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am surprised it is as stable as it is
Sat Nov 23 19:32:58 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is a code channel
Sat Nov 23 19:33:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless you have a code question Ferris, shut the fuck up
Sat Nov 23 19:33:28 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Batzing you cannot with that version of mudos
Sat Nov 23 19:33:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am releasing a new one soon I hope
Sat Nov 23 19:34:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:perhapos removing Dreamverse from intermud channels will fix the problem
Sat Nov 23 19:35:18 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry, ferris, but you don't have a clue
Sat Nov 23 19:36:03 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nippie is right... Cal, take it to intergossip
Sat Nov 23 19:36:19 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ferris, writing intermud clients won't stop you from getting removed
Sat Nov 23 19:37:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is that Ferris?
Sat Nov 23 19:38:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ferris, just because it is free fdoes not mean you don't have to folow my licemnse
Sat Nov 23 19:39:28 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:before I knock Dreamverse off of imud gossip as well...
Sat Nov 23 19:39:48 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want to make sure Ferris is very clear I own the Nightmare mudlib everyone is using
Sat Nov 23 19:40:42 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not know... I am working on it right now
Sat Nov 23 19:40:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bye bye Dreamverse
Sat Nov 23 19:42:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this for a class?
Sat Nov 23 19:45:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 it is more proper
Sat Nov 23 19:45:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which leads to other reasons, like I wanted to make vehicles and such
Sat Nov 23 19:46:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I consulted with Beek on this, and he suggested that it is not signficatn
Sat Nov 23 19:46:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:# of lines is a meaningless thing
Sat Nov 23 19:48:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Idonot udnerstand what you mena by file pointer
Sat Nov 23 19:49:49 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, basically yes
Sat Nov 23 21:21:23 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Nov 23 21:30:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Nov 23 21:31:24 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Nov 23 21:31:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, what do you mean by a successfully application to your aobject?
Sat Nov 23 21:32:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you return a 0 if the verb makes no sense at all
Sat Nov 23 21:32:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you return a string if it is close, but situationally wrong
Sat Nov 23 21:33:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:shrug... never seen that before
Sat Nov 23 21:34:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, someone was wrong :)
Sat Nov 23 21:35:15 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:given that sucj a thing would be noticed in an instant on NBM, I tend to think it is a problem with your code
Sat Nov 23 21:36:09 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would look at stuff you changed
Sat Nov 23 21:51:12 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if building your mud is featuritis then, that is a sick definitionof featuritis :)
Sat Nov 23 22:01:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a lib is a LIBRARY
Sat Nov 23 22:01:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you build on top of libraries
Sat Nov 23 22:54:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what problem?
Sat Nov 23 22:57:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be your terminal emulation and not the liv
Sat Nov 23 22:57:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, youre client program
Sat Nov 23 23:41:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:friggin NM configure scripts work fine
Sat Nov 23 23:42:14 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe expecting you to read the install directions is too much...
Sat Nov 23 23:43:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kriton, the NM install instructions are very short, and very moron proof
Sat Nov 23 23:43:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:RTFM
Sat Nov 23 23:44:50 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, not having prl on a UNIX system is like not having water in a shower
Sat Nov 23 23:46:47 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in some parts of arkjansas, brothers ansd sisters mate to have little presidents
Sat Nov 23 23:49:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean NM 3.2 allows people who do not follow the directions to install it?
Sat Nov 23 23:51:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should try the windows install
Sun Nov 24 00:14:20 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does anyone happen to have the source code for v22b13 around/
Sun Nov 24 00:14:36 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like, anyone with NM IVr3 lying around would
Sun Nov 24 00:17:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unfortunately, the earliest version I have to go against is v22b16
Sun Nov 24 00:17:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would probably work
Sun Nov 24 00:21:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, IMHO, it is not a mudlib problem
Sun Nov 24 00:21:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a stupid feature of LPC which is completely ignorable
Sun Nov 24 00:33:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yuck
Sun Nov 24 00:33:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what in particular are you doing?
Sun Nov 24 00:35:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I thought i did the mailer around NM 3.1.1
Sun Nov 24 00:35:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes., there will be intermud mail someday
Sun Nov 24 00:38:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Nov 24 00:53:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, something like eventTrainSpell()
Sun Nov 24 10:51:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sizeof int is always 32 bits
Sun Nov 24 10:51:08 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no matter what archjitecture
Sun Nov 24 10:56:26 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:their environments are probably getting destructed
Sun Nov 24 11:02:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:before I release MudOS for Windows 0.6.1, can anyone tell me what they want to see in it?
Sun Nov 24 12:17:35 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't like what?
Sun Nov 24 12:18:25 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:complete reqs?
Sun Nov 24 12:31:25 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't have access to remove people from intermud
Sun Nov 24 12:35:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, now that the hostility is out of the way, what happenbed is they were temp banned from two intermud channels owned by IE
Sun Nov 24 12:36:04 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is because they were spouting abuse, especially Ferris
Sun Nov 24 12:36:22 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I believe there are people on right now who can attest to that
Sun Nov 24 12:37:27 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe he wasn't :)
Sun Nov 24 13:09:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 0.6.1 Test:test
Sun Nov 24 13:11:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@WinMud 0.6.1 Test:win32 is all you get
Tue Dec  3 17:07:18 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there with access to the router?
Tue Dec  3 17:07:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some dorks are listed as being NM who are not NM
Tue Dec  3 17:10:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not sure what it checks
Tue Dec  3 17:20:46 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:has anyone seen the H7 page with responses to Lima's criticisms?
Tue Dec  3 17:21:29 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I posted replies to his responses on r.g.m.lp
Tue Dec  3 17:21:55 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:plus a host of other criticisms, including points against H7's so-called strong points
Tue Dec  3 17:22:23 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I forget what it is
Tue Dec  3 17:22:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you could find it in the post to which I reply
Tue Dec  3 17:22:43 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically Angel put up a new ad
Tue Dec  3 17:23:01 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and referred to the web page, and I found the web page so odd I had to reply
Tue Dec  3 22:14:52 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grep Set* /lib/mayor.c
Tue Dec  3 22:16:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is there for you to do whatever you want
Tue Dec  3 22:17:32 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never do patches
Tue Dec  3 22:30:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:off with his head!
Tue Dec  3 22:31:30 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:off with their heads!
Tue Dec  3 22:33:20 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:off with Pinkfish's head!!!
Tue Dec  3 22:33:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is not an idle gossip channel, take it to intercre
Tue Dec  3 22:33:55 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err intergossip
Tue Dec  3 22:34:35 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the FCC can bite my bottom
Tue Dec  3 22:38:44 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what else would I do if I hacked everyone who threatened me or NM?
Tue Dec  3 22:40:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:putting a backdoor in would bring my credibility into question
Tue Dec  3 22:40:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how unimaginative ian
Tue Dec  3 22:41:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trust me, if I wanted to put a back door in, I could get one in that only a very few people would be able to find
Tue Dec  3 22:41:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can code C just fine myself, thanks :)
Tue Dec  3 22:42:19 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did do the database efuns :)
Tue Dec  3 22:43:16 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people don't use the standard driver release with NM
Tue Dec  3 22:43:54 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Bill Gates is an admin on NM
Tue Dec  3 22:44:26 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare
Tue Dec  3 22:44:52 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some dork put up a Nightmare under another IP while we were down
Tue Dec  3 22:45:40 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am pretty sure too... I woulkd have to have killed him
Tue Dec  3 22:47:53 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, that sucks
Wed Dec  4 10:05:17 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:can anyone hear me?
Wed Dec  4 10:05:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:hello, can anyone hear me?
Wed Dec  4 10:06:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what rcp message?
Wed Dec  4 10:06:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yeah, I had to axe my .o here was the problem
Wed Dec  4 10:07:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yep
Wed Dec  4 10:07:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I actually think it was restored from backup
Wed Dec  4 10:08:56 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, I don't have a personal router :)
Wed Dec  4 10:09:06 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yep
Wed Dec  4 10:09:12 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:but only one exists
Wed Dec  4 10:09:48 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:they are what is holding up NM V
Wed Dec  4 10:10:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:hopefully later this month
Wed Dec  4 10:10:43 1996: imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:http://www.imaginary.com/protocols/intermud3.html
Wed Dec  4 10:11:21 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I do not recommend I2 (CDUDP) support
Wed Dec  4 10:11:59 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:there is a redirect
Wed Dec  4 10:12:49 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:actually, I also put in a redirect for www.imaginary.com/LPC/Lima
Wed Dec  4 10:17:33 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:me too :_)
Wed Dec  4 12:25:16 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:multi-class does too work :)
Wed Dec  4 12:26:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, then you did something wrong :)
Wed Dec  4 12:29:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:assuming the classes both were added
Wed Dec  4 12:29:46 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Dec  4 12:29:54 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such class as assassin
Wed Dec  4 12:30:22 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and removeclass it
Wed Dec  4 12:51:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Dec  4 12:55:06 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Dec  4 12:56:40 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Dec  4 12:57:02 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean by multi-class does not work anyways?
Wed Dec  4 12:58:05 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to be a high mortal to join anothuer class
Wed Dec  4 12:59:27 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:aelwyn, this is the code line, not the bu;llshit line
Wed Dec  4 12:59:45 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a big screen TV :)
Sat Dec  7 10:44:37 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to keep people from idling
Sat Dec  7 10:45:10 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it keeps people from idling
Sat Dec  7 10:45:38 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you asked why it did that :)
Sat Dec  7 10:46:00 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:excuse me?
Sat Dec  7 10:47:04 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:help addclass
Sat Dec  7 10:48:39 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not found?
Sat Dec  7 10:49:29 1996: imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so you are telling me you did not even follow the directions?
Sat Dec  7 11:16:31 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh heh heh, Beek said drugs
Sat Dec  7 11:18:14 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mystic is
Sat Dec  7 14:02:47 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I burned all the tickle me elmo's
Sat Dec  7 14:03:42 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that sounds lik it has a different audience :)
Sat Dec  7 14:06:51 1996: imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are both muppets
