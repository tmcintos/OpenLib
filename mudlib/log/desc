Sun Dec  3 23:14:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sun Dec  3 23:21:39 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry... was away
Sun Dec  3 23:21:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now it is going through someserious changes
Sun Dec  3 23:22:15 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my target is to have a web-based client by Q2 1996
Tue Dec  5 15:54:08 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ca va?
Tue Dec  5 15:55:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:alright, just curious how the 4.2.2 installs are going :)
Tue Dec  5 15:59:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:encre joe user
Tue Dec  5 15:59:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:<HEAD> is right
Tue Dec  5 16:07:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:be seeing you
Tue Dec  5 19:56:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we had a lot of muds on here this morning, what happened to them all?
Tue Dec  5 20:03:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:free cookies!!!!!!!!!!!
Tue Dec  5 20:07:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on intergossip, not on intercre :)
Tue Dec  5 20:09:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are virtual, so basically whatever kind you want
Tue Dec  5 20:09:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... no docs on poisoning I don't thibnk :)
Tue Dec  5 20:10:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on Doors? there are door docs
Tue Dec  5 20:10:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are docs on monsters now
Tue Dec  5 20:10:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks Raistlin :)
Tue Dec  5 20:12:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the doors worked fine
Tue Dec  5 20:12:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would bet Sinistrad tweaked them to break other systems
Tue Dec  5 20:12:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IVr2.2
Tue Dec  5 20:13:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not the way doors shio
Tue Dec  5 20:15:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, I think he made a change that breaks other systems
Tue Dec  5 20:15:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me tell you what happened...
Tue Dec  5 20:15:36 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on NM, id fields must be all lower case
Tue Dec  5 20:15:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you set your key id to mixed case
Tue Dec  5 20:16:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thus it never matched the id of anything
Tue Dec  5 20:16:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so Sinistrad went in and mucked with the id code
Tue Dec  5 20:16:22 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is wrong
Tue Dec  5 20:16:32 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you simply should not have had mixed case key id;s
Tue Dec  5 20:16:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not the problem,
Tue Dec  5 20:16:56 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is what you have in the key id field for doors
Tue Dec  5 20:17:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the door object
Tue Dec  5 20:19:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, Selene, for all objects
Tue Dec  5 20:19:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetId() converts anything to lowe case
Tue Dec  5 20:19:53 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand the question Raistlin
Tue Dec  5 20:22:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, help in secure commands is not set up at this time
Tue Dec  5 20:23:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tail /secure/cmds/creator/call.c
Tue Dec  5 20:24:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because the expression 'black key' returns true for the door
Tue Dec  5 20:25:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I meant key
Tue Dec  5 20:25:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, actually, I can't answer that question
Tue Dec  5 20:25:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it *is* somehting you all did however
Tue Dec  5 20:25:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:doors on Nightmare work fine
Tue Dec  5 20:26:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare IV even
Tue Dec  5 20:35:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange::)
Tue Dec  5 20:36:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how beautiful what is?
Tue Dec  5 20:37:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh *nod* I knew that would be a paradigm shift for people used to door coding
Tue Dec  5 20:38:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however, for people who have never coded on LPMuds before, a door *is* a separate object
Tue Dec  5 20:39:49 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Tue Dec  5 20:41:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, thanks :)  you guys should also let Blitz and Rush on NM know, they have had a large part in this
Tue Dec  5 20:42:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:r2.2
Tue Dec  5 20:43:28 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:keep in mind, however, they reflect any changes that haveoccurred.... mostly they will work for r1, but in some cases they will be wrong for r1
Tue Dec  5 20:43:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rust, you know, I just now got that?
Tue Dec  5 20:45:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand the question
Tue Dec  5 20:46:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I still do not understand what you are asking :)
Tue Dec  5 20:46:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes :)
Wed Dec  6 15:06:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:: delimted
Wed Dec  6 15:08:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it wraps text according to the users screen width
Wed Dec  6 15:46:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, there will be
Wed Dec  6 15:47:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Wed Dec  6 15:56:41 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:player or creator
Wed Dec  6 15:57:50 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek gets the credit for that
Wed Dec  6 16:01:45 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you want to add a neck?
Wed Dec  6 16:02:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the have the necklace protect the torso
Wed Dec  6 16:02:51 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, it should be armour type A_AMULET
Wed Dec  6 16:02:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what an amulet is
Wed Dec  6 16:03:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you have a necklace  does not require you to go adding necks
Wed Dec  6 16:03:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just type "wear amulet"
Wed Dec  6 16:03:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cat /include/armour_types.h
Wed Dec  6 16:04:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then there is a bug in someone's code
Wed Dec  6 16:07:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LIB_LIGHT
Wed Dec  6 16:08:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you need a reason to add a neck
Wed Dec  6 16:08:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not IMHO
Wed Dec  6 16:12:40 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Selene, we have already determined there is a bug in someone's code
Wed Dec  6 16:13:23 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it may be yours, I have no idea
Wed Dec  6 21:00:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:could people look at http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/API/object.html and tell me what you think about the documentation layout
Wed Dec  6 21:00:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:btw... that is NS 2.0 beta only
Wed Dec  6 21:04:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no comments?
Wed Dec  6 21:09:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, I suppose there is always the MS internet explorer :)
Wed Dec  6 21:15:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry, lost my link... did anyone manage to have a look?
Wed Dec  6 21:17:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Wed Dec  6 21:18:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Dec  6 21:23:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create filename room
Wed Dec  6 21:25:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cd to your home dir
Wed Dec  6 21:25:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and type 'create testroom.c room'
Thu Dec  7 18:51:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:workng on it :)
Thu Dec  7 18:51:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is /doc/build/Guilds
Thu Dec  7 18:51:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no examples though
Thu Dec  7 18:52:36 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm, nope, sorry, it does not yet exist
Thu Dec  7 18:55:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the guild object already allows leaders to make new members by simply issuing a command
Thu Dec  7 21:18:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:definitely comes after 137
Thu Dec  7 21:36:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he would not have a good thing to say about mother teresa
Thu Dec  7 21:37:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:here we go?
Thu Dec  7 21:38:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Thu Dec  7 21:53:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, at its creation
Thu Dec  7 21:53:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at no other time
Thu Dec  7 21:53:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what a virtual object is
Thu Dec  7 21:54:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Thu Dec  7 21:54:55 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorta, but not arbitrary
Thu Dec  7 21:55:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically, it will try to load a wierd fiel, like /realms/.descartes/cheese.t
Thu Dec  7 21:55:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that don't exist, so before it fails, it gives you a chance to clone an object and call it that
Fri Dec  8 21:32:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I see only 4 muds have not upgraded to IVr2.2 :)
Fri Dec  8 21:32:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is a persistance patch posted to the NM bug tracking system
Sat Dec  9 21:46:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I have been told
Sat Dec  9 22:10:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every mudlib on this line already has it working
Sun Dec 10 16:45:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because arrays are a pointer type
Sun Dec 10 16:45:57 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and all ({}) arrays point to the same array
Sun Dec 10 16:47:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:({0,}) may point to a different array from your other ({0,})
Sun Dec 10 17:20:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:create filename room
Sun Dec 10 17:21:58 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the same as ed
Sun Dec 10 17:23:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetInventory()
Sun Dec 10 17:24:05 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do not use reset()
Sun Dec 10 17:24:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one sec
Sun Dec 10 17:27:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetInventory() is a more efficient manner of doing the trick
Sun Dec 10 17:28:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let me put it another way, why would you mess with writing a reset() function and all that could go wrong when you can simply use SetInventory()?
Sun Dec 10 17:28:24 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't SetInventory() automatically takes care of that
Sun Dec 10 17:31:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reset() should rarely be used on NM muds any more... keep in mind objects are permanent
Sun Dec 10 17:31:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes Novatron, though Kalinash is working on something better
Sun Dec 10 17:33:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is certainly a buggy system... are you sure you are connecting to mud port -10
Sun Dec 10 17:37:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you have a file ~novatron/adm/remote.c?
Sun Dec 10 17:38:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, that would do it :)
Sun Dec 10 17:41:14 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#include <lib.h>   inherit LIB_REMOTE;
Sun Dec 10 17:41:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only two lines for the file
Sun Dec 10 19:17:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rmdir
Sun Dec 10 20:06:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define not working
Sun Dec 10 20:07:31 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you did not set its meal type right
Sun Dec 10 20:09:34 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is this something you just coded or something someone had, then logged out, then logged on with?
Sun Dec 10 20:10:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did *you* try to dribk it?
Sun Dec 10 20:10:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cres can't drink or eat
Sun Dec 10 20:10:52 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why should they?
Sun Dec 10 20:11:08 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, cres are things that code
Sun Dec 10 20:11:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not players
Sun Dec 10 20:11:24 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:having heart beats and all that extra player overhead is a waste
Sun Dec 10 20:11:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cres do not have heart beats
Sun Dec 10 20:12:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's right... a mortal player is a much better gauge of play testing than is a cre
Sun Dec 10 20:12:10 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:interactive != has a heart beat
Sun Dec 10 20:13:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, in NM, interactive means inherits interactive.c
Sun Dec 10 20:13:21 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and interactive generally means responding to program output
Sun Dec 10 20:18:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what mud clients are for
Sun Dec 10 20:19:23 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a test on an objct not involved in a process is not a test
Sun Dec 10 20:21:21 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it very piossibly could be Jolt
Sun Dec 10 20:21:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:besides, it is a waste of resources
Sun Dec 10 20:22:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creators != players
Sun Dec 10 20:23:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)
Sun Dec 10 20:24:04 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sun Dec 10 20:25:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I imagine it will get through... Netscape == HTML now
Sun Dec 10 20:27:35 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all data members are protected
Sun Dec 10 20:27:43 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but can be made private
Sun Dec 10 20:28:20 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops, all data members are protected by default (but that is called public) and can be made private through the private keyword
Sun Dec 10 20:28:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:functions are public by default, but can be made protected (static) or private
Sun Dec 10 20:38:37 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand the quesiton
Sun Dec 10 20:40:57 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, you do SetItems() on the monster
Sun Dec 10 20:41:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should never describe one object through another object
Sun Dec 10 20:41:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to inherit LIB_ITEMS in the monster
Sun Dec 10 22:32:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/news/creator
Sun Dec 10 22:35:20 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes?
Sun Dec 10 22:38:09 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is odd about that?
Sun Dec 10 22:38:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope, you are supposed to get them in thirds or halves or something
Sun Dec 10 22:40:33 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 recode it to do that #2 update the events daemon
Sun Dec 10 22:51:59 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:y localized in a functional
Sun Dec 10 22:54:08 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:meaning if you have a local variable
Sun Dec 10 22:54:22 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and then you want it avilable to a functional to be evaluated later
Sun Dec 10 22:54:38 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to reference it in the functional as $(local_var)
Sun Dec 10 22:55:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the functional construct operator (: :) knows to evaluate the local variable now
Sun Dec 10 22:55:52 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the func... void foo() { function f; int x; x = 5; f = (: write($(x)) :);
Sun Dec 10 22:56:04 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:$(x) is set to 5
Sun Dec 10 22:56:20 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to understand functionals for it not be confusing
Sun Dec 10 22:57:43 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC is not C
Sun Dec 10 22:57:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC is an object oriented programming language
Sun Dec 10 22:58:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:C is a language to make geeks feel they are cool
Sun Dec 10 22:59:11 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just the while() for() stuff :)
Sun Dec 10 23:00:44 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:advanced is not out yet :)
Sun Dec 10 23:02:52 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call O'Reilly and Associates and ask them if they have any books on LPC
Sun Dec 10 23:04:03 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are in Boston
Sun Dec 10 23:09:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which NM pages? the doc pages? or the rest of it?
Sun Dec 10 23:12:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I agree Rassilon... that is why all the pages of NM will end up with a white bg
Mon Dec 11 19:19:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bing
Tue Dec 12 18:08:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:runtime really does not get you much
Tue Dec 12 18:08:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO
Tue Dec 12 18:17:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I think force does not exist yet
Tue Dec 12 18:18:26 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:this is not NM 3.2.2
Tue Dec 12 18:18:32 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Tue Dec 12 18:18:42 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in code it is simply ob->eventForce(cmd)
Tue Dec 12 18:19:37 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, force should be a verb
Tue Dec 12 18:19:45 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:but you could do it  as a command too
Tue Dec 12 18:19:53 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in which case you are right
Tue Dec 12 18:21:29 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:this is NM 3? or NM IV?
Tue Dec 12 18:22:01 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:they are important
Tue Dec 12 18:22:09 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you should not be intercepting the commands
Tue Dec 12 18:22:25 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in NM IV you handle it in eventReleaseObject()
Tue Dec 12 18:22:40 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and in NM 3 I think it is called release_objects()
Tue Dec 12 18:23:06 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:any time you define the same command in multiple places you are only creating bugs and user confusion
Tue Dec 12 18:24:16 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you can do SetTouch() in an object just like Listen, Smell, and Searcg
Tue Dec 12 18:25:02 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_TOUCH
Tue Dec 12 18:25:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:from inside move
Tue Dec 12 18:25:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:adding that action is bad
Tue Dec 12 18:25:56 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that is why it matters if you use NM IV
Tue Dec 12 18:26:39 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Tue Dec 12 18:26:49 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is an event that handles the go command
Tue Dec 12 18:27:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Tue Dec 12 18:27:25 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:err wrong Selene, I mean
Tue Dec 12 18:28:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:SetSmell() is LIB_SMELL, SetItems() is LIB_ITEMS, SetTouch() is LIB_TOUCH, etc
Tue Dec 12 18:28:49 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:move checks release_objects, therefore going checks it
Tue Dec 12 18:29:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:on NM 3? it does not
Tue Dec 12 18:29:56 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:eventGo() and eventEnter()
Tue Dec 12 18:30:18 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:which trigger the move event, which trigger the release object event, which triggers the receive object event
Tue Dec 12 18:30:26 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you override
Tue Dec 12 18:31:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not using a shadow, using normal lpc
Tue Dec 12 18:32:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no, there is no reason at all for shadows here
Tue Dec 12 18:32:28 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:alter it just in the rooms you want it altered
Tue Dec 12 18:36:00 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it really depends, that is the right way to do it, it is not clumsy
Tue Dec 12 18:37:04 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:now that second idea is nasty
Tue Dec 12 18:37:40 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:because it is error prone
Tue Dec 12 18:37:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and LPC is not as slow as you think
Tue Dec 12 18:39:25 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LPC is not your problem
Tue Dec 12 18:54:29 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEMS
Tue Dec 12 18:55:01 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, that does work :)
Tue Dec 12 18:56:12 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there was documentation on this with the lib
Tue Dec 12 18:56:26 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there are other thigns you need to do
Tue Dec 12 18:56:36 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:which I do not remember off the top of my head
Tue Dec 12 19:01:01 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEMS
Tue Dec 12 19:01:09 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEMS has SetItems()
Tue Dec 12 19:01:21 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:LIB_ITEM is  simple item,. like a wepaon
Tue Dec 12 19:02:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Tue Dec 12 19:14:35 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I am all alone in the supermarket, I can no longer shop happily
Tue Dec 12 19:15:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the clash :)
Tue Dec 12 22:20:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it converts a mixed case name into a unique id
Wed Dec 13 09:12:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thee
Wed Dec 13 09:12:56 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thou is second person subjective
Wed Dec 13 09:14:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, the name of the driver is LPMud 03.02.1@121
Wed Dec 13 09:14:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Amylaar is not the name of the driver
Wed Dec 13 13:52:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:TMI-2 is easier than NM???? when id you code a NM IV lib?
Wed Dec 13 13:55:33 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Kalypso, like you have a clue
Wed Dec 13 13:57:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:clearly not NM IV
Wed Dec 13 13:57:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you are either and idiot or a liar :)
Wed Dec 13 13:58:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that tmi-2 design has been pretty much dismissed by most people, and people have moved on :)
Wed Dec 13 13:59:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why Kalypso? so if you misspell short you get an error you cannot debug?
Wed Dec 13 14:00:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, then you perfectly code a really slow and insecure lib :)
Wed Dec 13 15:09:08 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what's that?
Wed Dec 13 15:10:22 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean not allowed? target muds filter them
Wed Dec 13 15:11:07 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too bad
Wed Dec 13 15:12:09 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if a mud does nto want to see the codes, it should filter them out
Wed Dec 13 15:12:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never saw such intent, and I would never have agreed to such intent
Wed Dec 13 15:15:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the DW colour codes are stabdard
Wed Dec 13 15:15:53 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare will not stop sending them
Wed Dec 13 15:17:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am just stating that I do not believe that is right
Wed Dec 13 15:18:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fine, I will still send colours
Wed Dec 13 15:24:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the DW protocols are a defacto standard
Wed Dec 13 15:24:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:furthermore, when we started on this I3 stuff, it was my understanding they would be treated as a real standard for the intermud
Wed Dec 13 15:25:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every MudOS mudlib supports them
Wed Dec 13 15:25:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coding support for them is trivial
Wed Dec 13 15:26:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:even if it is just to filter them out
Wed Dec 13 15:26:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:other drivers and server types can use them
Wed Dec 13 15:29:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then they can deal with my % and ^ and FLASH and % and ^
Wed Dec 13 15:30:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if most muds on this line are not supporting that, then it serves no purpose to send that
Wed Dec 13 15:30:19 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it si communicating nothing
Wed Dec 13 15:30:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but as long as muds are, I am going to use it is a method of communication
Wed Dec 13 15:36:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who formatting is up to receiving muds now :)
Wed Dec 13 15:36:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it is communication as long as your target audience for the most part can understand it
Wed Dec 13 15:36:49 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it does not hurt anyone
Wed Dec 13 15:38:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they can easily filter it out, and it does not hamper usage by other systems
Wed Dec 13 15:39:28 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a non-argument
Wed Dec 13 15:39:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not faced with a Tower of Babel of colour protocols
Wed Dec 13 15:39:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have 1
Wed Dec 13 15:40:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, if a lot of Dikus show up not using this protocol, then it makes me using colour codes to communicate stupid since most people will not understand them, eh?
Wed Dec 13 15:41:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but as long as the vast majority do, I will continue to communicate using them
Wed Dec 13 15:44:12 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:looking at this mudlist I see only 2 that do not
Wed Dec 13 15:44:34 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Discworld supports it, Lima supports it, tmi-2 supports it
Wed Dec 13 15:44:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's not what Beek told me
Wed Dec 13 15:45:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh well, then I gather it must be your intention to support it
Wed Dec 13 15:46:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:either way, I don't much care :)
Wed Dec 13 15:47:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am thinking about users who by vast majority like colours
Wed Dec 13 15:48:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I see DB's point on that... he thinks that would become an impediment to Dikus and such joining
Wed Dec 13 15:50:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my argument is that prohibiting it does not further that cause
Wed Dec 13 15:50:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is definitely true :)
Wed Dec 13 15:52:24 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also... if Dikus and MOOs and MUSH'es were beating down the door to join I3, I would be willing to reconsider my stance
Wed Dec 13 15:52:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but the fact is that I3 right now and for the forseeable future is mostly LP, specifically MudOS
Wed Dec 13 15:54:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I for one would be willig to help
Wed Dec 13 15:59:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, I agree... though you may have a hard time defining what a player is for some MUD systems
Wed Dec 13 16:00:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depend son you rmudlib
Wed Dec 13 16:00:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes it does
Wed Dec 13 16:04:46 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think you think I argue about thinking you argue
Wed Dec 13 16:06:14 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, he hates strawberry
Wed Dec 13 16:06:22 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with a viciously bigoted mind
Wed Dec 13 16:11:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 you should not specify a limb for monster wielding
Wed Dec 13 16:11:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:keep in mind also some monster races may not even have wielding limbs.
Wed Dec 13 16:11:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:can a player wear the thing?
Wed Dec 13 16:14:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would indicate something about your monster is not right then
Wed Dec 13 16:15:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not understand what exactly is ot working...
Wed Dec 13 16:17:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right...
Wed Dec 13 16:17:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and when does it not work?
Wed Dec 13 16:23:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chocolate is the solution to all problems
Wed Dec 13 16:23:30 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hello
Wed Dec 13 16:23:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do not know tmi-2
Wed Dec 13 16:41:17 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:lars pensji C
Wed Dec 13 16:49:10 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetWander(x) randomly chooses a path
Wed Dec 13 18:15:02 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:here
Wed Dec 13 18:15:24 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to be one :)
Wed Dec 13 18:15:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IE is not a mudlib support site
Wed Dec 13 18:19:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want to teach, just let me know what sortof structure you need
Wed Dec 13 18:39:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why?
Wed Dec 13 18:39:45 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so you can be an ass on one?
Wed Dec 13 18:39:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you figure if you just put up a dummy mud you can be a fuckwit?
Wed Dec 13 18:57:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:argument 1 to fp
Wed Dec 13 19:42:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who let out all these assholes?
Wed Dec 13 19:57:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in the room doc
Wed Dec 13 20:03:57 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:RTFN
Wed Dec 13 20:04:01 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err RTFM
Wed Dec 13 20:55:55 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Misery, you are such a fuckhead
Wed Dec 13 20:56:05 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is not whether they make hb static
Wed Dec 13 20:56:13 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is assholes like you who just cause trouble
Wed Dec 13 20:56:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't drink coffee, I am naturally this fun to be with
Wed Dec 13 20:58:20 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whee!!! got who and finger gatewats back up for NM and IE :)(
Wed Dec 13 20:58:56 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayuh
Wed Dec 13 21:06:33 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know, they give me a woody too
Wed Dec 13 21:10:30 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would be what nomask means
Wed Dec 13 21:11:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I would not think it beyond credibility that you simply don;t know what you are doing
Wed Dec 13 21:42:18 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:supposed to be this weekend
Wed Dec 13 21:42:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe the weekend after though
Wed Dec 13 21:42:59 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can put it off for those
Wed Dec 13 21:43:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want to try to make this the last release with feature additions
Wed Dec 13 22:02:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no reaosn on earth for it
Wed Dec 13 22:03:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, it works, but again, there is no reason to do it
Wed Dec 13 22:03:16 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use CreRemote
Wed Dec 13 23:00:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:IMHO, you are talking about some rather big differences there, I don't think you can find a BEST, justa best for you
Wed Dec 13 23:01:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:although, I would be interested in hearing how you evaluate each strength's and weaknesses
Wed Dec 13 23:01:27 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just cres
Wed Dec 13 23:02:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any thoughts right now?
Wed Dec 13 23:07:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what would you is Lima's strongest point?
Wed Dec 13 23:11:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:deal with it people
Wed Dec 13 23:12:19 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds like a personal problem
Wed Dec 13 23:16:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I plan to do something for menuing and administration
Wed Dec 13 23:16:58 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that will probably come with NM VI, which is intended to be a heavy UI release
Wed Dec 13 23:17:26 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:UI == user interface
Wed Dec 13 23:18:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM does too
Wed Dec 13 23:19:09 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:admittedly, NM VI probably will not come out til next summer though
Wed Dec 13 23:19:19 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and no one on this line should much care about NM VI :)
Wed Dec 13 23:19:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone on this line using NM should stop worrying about upgrades once NM V is released
Wed Dec 13 23:19:51 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which mudlist? the mudlist command?
Wed Dec 13 23:21:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlist commands automatically removes and adds muds as they disconnect and connect from the I3
Thu Dec 14 07:25:32 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean undirected messages?
Thu Dec 14 07:27:03 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not using the any of the mudos messaging schemes, no... NM does messaging OO... ob->Pritn()
Thu Dec 14 07:27:15 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so you would intercept that
Thu Dec 14 07:27:47 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but catch_tell() is called only in things that are 'living'
Thu Dec 14 07:28:11 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the actual method is eventPrint() on NM
Thu Dec 14 07:34:05 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, NM may be switching ip #'s
Thu Dec 14 07:34:25 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this should improve its routing, as winternet seems to be having problems with the 199.* group
Thu Dec 14 07:34:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no :) not yet
Thu Dec 14 07:34:53 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is important to know, however, for router purposes
Thu Dec 14 07:35:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at that point it would e too late anyways :)
Thu Dec 14 07:36:36 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh
Thu Dec 14 07:56:50 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone put any thoght into intermud mail?
Thu Dec 14 07:59:39 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is a full protocol on the i3 spec?
Thu Dec 14 07:59:57 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is mail OOB?
Sun Dec 17 22:11:23 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and your point is Rot?
Sun Dec 17 22:12:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the next release is another alpha for NM V
Sun Dec 17 22:13:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the release number is IVr2.3
Sun Dec 17 22:13:44 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:login to Nightmare and see :)
Sun Dec 17 22:15:14 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it depend son the driver situation
Sun Dec 17 22:15:52 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, probably, you will have to get the whole download :)
Sun Dec 17 22:16:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I don't keep track of those :)
Sun Dec 17 22:17:31 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whats.news?
Sun Dec 17 22:19:28 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I would bet I did not hear your question
Sun Dec 17 22:19:40 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in general, Rust is right, I do not listen to this channel even
Sun Dec 17 22:20:42 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NMSU? no idea, it is easy to change
Sun Dec 17 22:21:06 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and no, I do not keep a changelog
Sun Dec 17 22:21:32 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because it does not fit my style of development
Sun Dec 17 22:24:29 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trust me, it is hard
Sun Dec 17 22:24:45 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are 3 ative mudlib developer sincluding myself all editing source
Sun Dec 17 22:26:00 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is that you are not supposed to make mudlib level changes until after NM V :)
Sun Dec 17 22:26:48 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I can think of a way to do changelogs or patch versions, I will do them
Sun Dec 17 22:26:54 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM V is mid-jan
Sun Dec 17 22:30:37 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:next weekend, I think
Sun Dec 17 22:31:21 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mid-jan... it is part of NM V
Sun Dec 17 22:37:41 1995:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean with a rela one?
Sun Dec 17 23:24:14 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no :(
Sun Dec 17 23:33:19 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:not sure what you are asking
Sun Dec 17 23:35:42 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in the event you are changing just the wander path at some point
Sun Dec 17 23:36:48 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:in create(), you always are gonna use SetWander()
Sun Dec 17 23:37:22 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Sun Dec 17 23:37:46 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:SetWanderPath() only sets the path
Sun Dec 17 23:38:07 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:like if later you want to change the path but no other settings
Sun Dec 17 23:38:27 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:for example, you write a room that re-doirects wandering monster
Sun Dec 17 23:38:41 1995:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you do not want to muck with their wander chance, etc
Mon Jan 15 22:56:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I do not understand what you are asking for MogwI
Mon Jan 15 22:58:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie :)
Tue Jan 16 07:54:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not releasing it until I take care of a couple of bugs
Tue Jan 16 07:54:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which probably means tonight
Tue Jan 16 07:54:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I will wait til this weekend if I have to
Tue Jan 16 08:01:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not yet
Sat Jan 20 19:28:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea, that's not what I do here :)
Sat Jan 20 19:31:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, then like the docs say, don't try until there are docs with NM V :)
Sat Jan 20 22:30:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you don;t change that mud name, pretty soon no one will see it
Sat Jan 20 22:38:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:PhoenixMud
Sat Jan 20 22:38:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:though you should change really quick yourself :)
Sat Jan 20 23:25:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sat Jan 20 23:31:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are here :)
Sat Jan 20 23:32:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:update /daemon/verbs.c
Sat Jan 20 23:32:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I probably used a preload.cfg from NM IVr2.1 on accident, and it is not preloading verbs.c
Sat Jan 20 23:56:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:why is that?
Sat Jan 20 23:57:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the verbs work fibne
Sat Jan 20 23:59:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you must have done something bizarre then
Sat Jan 20 23:59:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:or you are expecting it to do something it is not supposed to do
Sun Jan 21 00:02:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:one thing though, given that there are no rooms other than the start room with the mudlib, you can;t go much of anywhere
Sun Jan 21 01:54:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:grep SetTown /lib/*.c
Sun Jan 21 02:21:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:then change it
Sun Jan 21 02:24:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I told you to grep SetTown /lib/*.c
Sun Jan 21 02:24:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:better yet, grep for Praxis
Sun Jan 21 10:35:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah :)
Sun Jan 21 11:08:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:oops wrong line :)
Sun Jan 21 11:35:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:no gas!
Sun Jan 21 13:37:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:this is where I point out that the concept of a combat object is flawed :)
Sun Jan 21 13:37:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Nippe I am just making things up right now, to give a real answer, you have to look at the error causing it
Sun Jan 21 13:38:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:heart beats stop because an erro roccurred while they were executing
Sun Jan 21 13:38:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:/log/runtime is all runtime errors
Sun Jan 21 13:41:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that really does not fit the object model
Sun Jan 21 13:42:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should use a test char to test the game
Sun Jan 21 13:43:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i don;t understand what you are saying Raven
Sun Jan 21 14:08:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call fo->SetStat("whatever", stat_level, class) where class is a number between 1 anf 5, 1 being good 5 being bad
Sun Jan 21 14:12:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:several are involved
Sun Jan 21 14:14:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:there will be a full domain with NM V
Sun Jan 21 14:14:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:strength, coordination, agility
Sun Jan 21 18:34:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that would be impossible, since the lib has only been out a few months
Sun Jan 21 18:34:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not NM IV
Sun Jan 21 18:35:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the current lib is a new mudlib from scratch
Sun Jan 21 18:37:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use the one that most closeley matches what you are trying to do
Sun Jan 21 18:39:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, NM has that shit, dunno about others
Sun Jan 21 18:40:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope... guild skills and spells differ no more than class spells and skills
Sun Jan 21 18:42:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/lib/classes.c and /verbs/spells/*.c
Sun Jan 21 18:42:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:depend son what you do with them
Sun Jan 21 19:41:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you guys are gonna get your site banned from I3
Sun Jan 21 19:41:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this would be the first threat
Sun Jan 21 19:42:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but yes, it is a threat
Sun Jan 21 19:42:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayuh
Sun Jan 21 19:42:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are asking, then you are too stupid to understand the problem
Sun Jan 21 19:43:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don;t care what you think :)
Sun Jan 21 19:44:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so how about it? shut down the mud now or don't get on I3 under any name?
Sun Jan 21 19:45:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so be it
Sun Jan 21 19:49:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:takes a second to get rid of you
Sun Jan 21 19:54:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Sun Jan 21 19:55:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like normal
Sun Jan 21 19:55:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM muds and Lima muds at least allow you to enter the name
Sun Jan 21 19:56:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like: 'tell memnoch@realms of the shaded boo'
Sun Jan 21 19:57:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, those dorks are off of here
Sun Jan 21 20:01:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to_int()
Sun Jan 21 20:01:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, 1 + "";
Sun Jan 21 20:02:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Sun Jan 21 20:08:42 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right :)
Sun Jan 21 20:41:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/lib/classes.c
Sun Jan 21 20:43:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:could be anythng... probably did not set a valid race
Sun Jan 21 20:43:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you really need to look at the error in the error log
Sun Jan 21 22:02:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is to start the technical aspect that two muds cannot have the same name on I3
Sun Jan 21 22:02:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then beyond that, as Skylight saidm it is rude
Sun Jan 21 22:02:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:given that the original phoenix has been around 5 years
Sun Jan 21 22:03:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Phoenix has built up a certain name capital
Sun Jan 21 22:03:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:originally, it waas an accident
Sun Jan 21 22:03:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but when someone else pointed it out to them, they took the attitude of so what
Sun Jan 21 22:04:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some dude named Iam
Sun Jan 21 22:04:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, he died 300 years ago
Sun Jan 21 22:05:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they were not faced with the shut down or be banned until after they basically  turned their noses to the fact their were using someone else's mud name
Sun Jan 21 22:07:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is one of the pre-requisites... that names do not condlict
Sun Jan 21 22:09:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just grab the files off of IE
Sun Jan 21 22:10:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those are more up to date than the I3 dist... I have not updated that to req-3
Sun Jan 21 22:10:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud.c services.c and services/*.c
Sun Jan 21 22:11:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok... debugmalloc and check_memory are defined... why don;t I have a check_memory() efun :(
Sun Jan 21 22:17:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don;t compile IVr2.3 :)
Sun Jan 21 22:19:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, if you are having a problem compiling the driver you should mail those problems to mudos-bgs@imagianry.com
Sun Jan 21 22:19:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many points for a free pizza?
Sun Jan 21 22:22:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you must have v21.5 or later
Mon Jan 22 18:11:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NOTICE: I3 will *probably* be going down for a short time tomorrow night while imaginary.com upgrades its server
Mon Jan 22 21:35:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sentients, not npc;s
Mon Jan 22 22:01:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:one sec
Mon Jan 22 22:05:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can't :)
Mon Jan 22 22:05:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:started at v22a18
Mon Jan 22 22:06:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a bug
Mon Jan 22 22:06:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:none would
Mon Jan 22 22:06:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gotta dbx the core
Mon Jan 22 22:06:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Mon Jan 22 22:19:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which version of mudos?
Mon Jan 22 22:30:42 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LIB_SENTIENT
Mon Jan 22 22:31:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sentient inherits npc
Mon Jan 22 23:13:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:well, those bugs are fixed in v22a18
Mon Jan 22 23:13:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:but that is what IVr2.3 is for :)
Tue Jan 23 19:49:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no downtime tonight :) we are upgrading saturday :)
Tue Jan 23 19:51:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a sparc 5 upgrade board
Tue Jan 23 20:54:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:v22a18 slightly modified for solaris... added the D to help Beek tell the difference in bug reports
Wed Jan 24 21:00:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:vmstat
Thu Jan 25 22:49:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, they told you to shut up on intercre
Thu Jan 25 22:50:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to be pretty damn offensive to be told to shut up on here
Thu Jan 25 22:51:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh
Sat Jan 27 16:11:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, earth.imaginary.com should be right
Sat Jan 27 16:12:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:imaginary.com is working fine :) plus I have access to the imaginary hosts fiel now
Sat Jan 27 16:16:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does
Sat Jan 27 16:17:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your machine just has to recognize it
Sat Jan 27 16:17:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some machines cache host info, so it takes time to propogate changes
Sat Jan 27 16:17:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sat Jan 27 16:26:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rebooting this machine, I3 will go down a sec
Tue Jan 30 16:36:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sorry about all the problems :(
Tue Jan 30 16:37:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we got an upgrade cpu
Tue Jan 30 16:37:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but it was bum
Tue Jan 30 16:41:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:changeover?
Tue Jan 30 16:41:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh thje new ip # :) *nod*
Wed Jan 31 19:24:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Wed Jan 31 20:05:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:1.0 will not work with 2.3
Wed Jan 31 20:05:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you need 2.0
Wed Jan 31 20:30:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no it makes it primaruy
Wed Jan 31 20:38:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:nope, it does not
Wed Jan 31 20:38:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and yes, NM 3 did use exp :)
Wed Jan 31 20:39:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Pinkfish has the first issue ready, Lassondra is reviewng it
Wed Jan 31 20:42:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I don';t know, perobably the new web server is messed up
Wed Jan 31 20:43:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:faq general
Wed Jan 31 20:52:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:right
Wed Jan 31 20:59:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:j'existe!
Wed Jan 31 21:01:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp is such a cool thing, DUDE!
Wed Jan 31 21:02:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you use the skills, and they go up
Wed Jan 31 21:39:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:combat is slow for slow people
Wed Jan 31 21:39:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fast for fast people
Wed Jan 31 21:40:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only way to make it fast for everyone is to make everyone fast
Wed Jan 31 21:40:18 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and while you are at it, give them all 10000 hp :)
Wed Jan 31 21:41:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, it is based on your stats
Wed Jan 31 21:41:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and it is sup[posed to be sliggish for slow people
Wed Jan 31 21:42:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:basically
Wed Jan 31 21:43:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Wed Jan 31 21:45:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:i am saying that f yuor goal is to make everyone an awesome player when they login, go ahead and give everyone a heart beat of 2
Wed Jan 31 21:47:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am telling you that you can do it, but that in doing so, you are messing with one of the ways in which people better themselves
Wed Jan 31 21:47:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:its your mud, do what you want :)
Wed Jan 31 21:49:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the place that says set_heart_beat()
Wed Jan 31 22:25:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:ueber alles
Wed Jan 31 22:32:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:hands out free cheese.
Wed Jan 31 22:34:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes I can do that :)
Wed Jan 31 22:37:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:minnesota is huge for fishing
Wed Jan 31 22:42:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:minneapolis is probably 300-400k, the twin cities are over a mil
Wed Jan 31 22:44:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:twin cities... minneapolis and st paul, plus about a few dozen smaller cities surrpunding them
Wed Jan 31 22:46:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool
Wed Jan 31 22:46:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smokers suck
Wed Jan 31 22:46:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are welcome to kill yourself, just don;t take me with you
Wed Jan 31 22:47:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:believe i or not, thre is a difference between a by-rpoduct of our technology that keeps us running and sucking on smoke for the fun of it
Wed Jan 31 22:49:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when was the last time someone spitted chweing gum n your face?
Wed Jan 31 22:50:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, so that makes smoking ok?
Wed Jan 31 22:51:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am saying that is kind of different, because people do not in the course of cheewing gum force it upon you
Wed Jan 31 22:51:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smokers by default force their smoking on others
Wed Jan 31 22:52:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:loadly smacking gum never killed anyone
Wed Jan 31 22:53:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Dreldragon, you are a complete fool if you believe that :)
Wed Jan 31 22:53:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, a puff in the face can kill, and certainly makes people physically sick
Wed Jan 31 22:54:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:smaking gum is just plain annoying
Wed Jan 31 22:55:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:happy cancer sticks to ya Drel :)
Wed Jan 31 22:56:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:stik you, you shitting fuck sack?
Wed Jan 31 22:56:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sex is about the only habit I have that i can think of
Thu Feb  1 18:45:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:15000 watts of data!
Thu Feb  1 18:53:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the one that comes with the lib, though Kal has a new beta coming out this weekend I think
Thu Feb  1 18:55:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why not?
Thu Feb  1 21:00:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any idea what the coldest temperature measured on earth is?
Thu Feb  1 21:01:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trying to fix that bug in code is a bad idea
Thu Feb  1 21:01:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has neveer gotten to absolute zero on earth
Thu Feb  1 21:02:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:coldest air temperature
Thu Feb  1 21:02:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean the coldest known air temperature on earth
Thu Feb  1 21:02:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:labs is menaingless
Thu Feb  1 21:02:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ask a simple question and get a bunch o geek answers :)
Thu Feb  1 21:08:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said nature!
Fri Feb  2 12:32:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:have you worked with one before?
Fri Feb  2 12:32:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you might try crawling before you run
Fri Feb  2 12:33:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean you should code on one before you try starting one yourself
Fri Feb  2 12:34:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then do so on anothr mud like nightmare
Fri Feb  2 12:34:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we have no level requirement
Fri Feb  2 12:34:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nightmare.imaginary.com 1701 and ask lassondra
Fri Feb  2 12:35:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tell to lassondra until she zaps you
Fri Feb  2 12:37:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I jave not got intermud mail working yet :)
Fri Feb  2 14:06:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I2 was originally CD, yes

Fri Feb  2 14:07:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for charlmers computers club
Sun Feb  4 12:01:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on NM it is load_object()
Sun Feb  4 12:02:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as well as just about any other mudos mud
Sun Feb  4 12:03:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hio :)
Sun Feb  4 12:17:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who in particular?
Sun Feb  4 12:22:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I wrote virtual rooms for Nightmare IV, Pallando did them for 3
Sun Feb  4 12:22:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Pallando is around every now and then
Sun Feb  4 13:18:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Mon Feb  5 08:05:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare::
Mon Feb  5 08:07:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:ok, cept I am off to work :(
Mon Feb  5 11:35:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they need a head start just to keep up with the rest of the world
Mon Feb  5 11:42:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone comes to watch me mud wrestle with famous supermodels
Mon Feb  5 17:55:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ever heard of the alias command Leto>?
Mon Feb  5 17:58:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has that stuff
Mon Feb  5 17:58:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM just does not distribute its gateway objects
Mon Feb  5 17:59:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://nightmare.imaginary.com:1696/gateways/who
Mon Feb  5 18:00:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://nightmare.imaginary.com/:1696/gateways/mudlist
Mon Feb  5 18:02:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the mudlib ships with an http daemon
Mon Feb  5 18:02:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not ship with any pages, because I don't want a hundred other muds having pages that look just like NM LPMud
Mon Feb  5 18:03:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know :)
Mon Feb  5 18:03:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are cool pagees all over the net
Mon Feb  5 21:25:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:skinny puppy anyone?
Mon Feb  5 21:44:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:who are you?
Mon Feb  5 22:14:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you guys know parse_sentence() would return huge numbers?
Mon Feb  5 22:21:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:been round a long time
Mon Feb  5 22:32:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what about parse_sentence() returning nuinbers like 1234567
Mon Feb  5 22:32:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone experience that fun?
Mon Feb  5 22:33:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:v22a22
Mon Feb  5 22:46:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dunno that he would have changed the data type
Mon Feb  5 22:46:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also, the numbers are not consistent, and thus not indicative of that kind of mistake
Mon Feb  5 23:56:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there played with v22a21 or later?
Mon Feb  5 23:57:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you use the NLP stuff?
Mon Feb  5 23:57:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:parse_shit()
Mon Feb  5 23:58:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not that it is shit, it is cool :) just being mind numblingly cute
Mon Feb  5 23:58:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, the changes I got... I am having a problem parsing a particular situaiton
Mon Feb  5 23:59:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, lemme know how you end up handling this situation:
Mon Feb  5 23:59:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chest and bag in room
Mon Feb  5 23:59:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sword in bag, sword in chest
Tue Feb  6 00:00:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make "get sword from chest" get the sword from the chest, not return "which sword do you mean?"
Tue Feb  6 08:00:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ice on the road?
Wed Feb  7 22:26:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:the textbooks are being rewritten
Wed Feb  7 22:27:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:when the full rewrite is done, with the release of NM V
Wed Feb  7 22:41:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:actually, I think they started off very different, but Beek has had some taming effects on those differences :)
Wed Feb  7 22:42:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:also this MudOS parsing syste does force some design descisions on you
Wed Feb  7 22:42:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:who coded it for NM :)
Wed Feb  7 22:44:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I3?
Wed Feb  7 22:45:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I3 pre-dates Lima
Wed Feb  7 22:45:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:and the spec is not related to a mudlib
Wed Feb  7 22:46:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:no bragging necessary
Wed Feb  7 22:46:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:Rust I totally isagree with your view of I3 history
Wed Feb  7 22:47:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:Truilkan
Wed Feb  7 22:49:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I1 was an insane piece of shit
Wed Feb  7 22:49:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:yes
Wed Feb  7 22:52:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:err, actually it did get to around 90, that is when it got really nasty
Wed Feb  7 22:55:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:it already existed, but no one used it
Wed Feb  7 22:55:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:and it turned out to be buggy anyways
Wed Feb  7 23:04:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:get a real mudlib?
Wed Feb  7 23:06:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:wenn ich die rechte antworte haette wurde ich das euch geben
Wed Feb  7 23:06:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:would you like me to make up an answer?
Wed Feb  7 23:07:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:cause I don't have a clue other than for you to get a real mudlib
Wed Feb  7 23:07:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:amo mangeare spaghetti
Wed Feb  7 23:08:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I have been counting how many ways I know how to kill with just a touch
Wed Feb  7 23:08:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I reached 57 when you entered
Wed Feb  7 23:09:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:briseann na fear cloiche ans an sraad
Wed Feb  7 23:10:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:janet
Wed Feb  7 23:10:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:piss off misery
Wed Feb  7 23:13:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:I based my life off of different strokes
Wed Feb  7 23:14:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:age, god help me if people think I am old
Wed Feb  7 23:14:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:my birthday is coming up though :)
Wed Feb  7 23:14:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:aquarians rock
Wed Feb  7 23:16:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam
Wed Feb  7 23:18:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:it started off as the place to code the database stuff for LPC
Wed Feb  7 23:18:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:now it is also doing the NM verb conversion
Wed Feb  7 23:20:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:Do you guys see this gif?
Wed Feb  7 23:20:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:go ahead Molochai,
Wed Feb  7 23:20:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:make my day
Wed Feb  7 23:32:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:that would be one way from me t start filtering your mud from my muds
Wed Feb  7 23:34:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:abortion abortion abortion abortion
Thu Feb  8 14:42:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rien de nouveau
Thu Feb  8 14:43:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with NM IV you don't, you use verbs
Thu Feb  8 14:44:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any verb is automatically added to everyone
Thu Feb  8 14:45:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no such things as command paths
Thu Feb  8 14:46:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ed is not a verb, it is a command
Thu Feb  8 14:46:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, all verbs are always available to everyone
Thu Feb  8 15:12:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:abortion abortion abortion abortion
Thu Feb  8 15:16:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the abortion section is already deemed unconstitutional
Thu Feb  8 15:17:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:outside of the few bizaare freedom of speech issues, the overall bill itself is extremely important
Thu Feb  8 15:18:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what on earth are you guys talking about with respect to wearing things?
Thu Feb  8 15:19:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wear isa verb also, not a command
Thu Feb  8 15:20:03 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't take NM/MudOS advice from amylaar people
Thu Feb  8 15:20:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare does not use add_action()
Thu Feb  8 15:21:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only reason support for it even exists is because NM LPmud has legacy areas
Thu Feb  8 15:21:32 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:override the event call
Thu Feb  8 15:22:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, override and extend it
Thu Feb  8 15:22:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as Beek said, you never copy code
Thu Feb  8 15:22:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are copying code, then you are failing miserably at code reuse
Thu Feb  8 15:23:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:override means write your own eventWear(), extending it means calling ::eventWear()
Thu Feb  8 22:55:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no doc on building fishing spots yet
Sat Feb 10 10:24:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Sat Feb 10 10:26:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:banning names at the command line is not working yet
Sat Feb 10 10:27:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to use the call command to call the banish daemon
Sat Feb 10 10:35:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as a rule I never tell people to edit .o files
Sat Feb 10 10:36:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Sat Feb 10 10:45:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at least on a logically distinct, could be physically the same room
Sat Feb 10 10:48:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not at the moment
Sat Feb 10 10:48:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:they are part of the plan for the final release
Sat Feb 10 10:49:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:err, you totally misunderstand
Sat Feb 10 10:49:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:training centers are not for raising skills
Sat Feb 10 10:50:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the are a suppliment to get new players started
Sat Feb 10 10:50:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:train skills
Sat Feb 10 10:51:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:nothing
Sat Feb 10 10:52:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:training rooms however are not designed to be where people train all the time
Sat Feb 10 10:52:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:they just get people started, let them customize a bit
Sat Feb 10 10:52:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:they are supposed to train skills by dong
Sat Feb 10 10:52:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:doing
Sat Feb 10 10:53:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:yes, the faq
Sat Feb 10 10:53:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:training rooms are for anyone with training points
Sat Feb 10 10:54:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:training rooms are not needed
Sat Feb 10 11:37:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is just no one in their right mind is using tmi-2 :)
Sat Feb 10 11:38:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably the login object, but I certainly don;t know
Sat Feb 10 15:36:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if they are from my mud, I rid them
Sat Feb 10 15:38:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:filter that mud
Sat Feb 10 15:39:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:players should not have access to intermud chat lines
Sat Feb 10 15:39:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:however, we give tell, rwho, mudlist, and finger support to plaers
Sun Feb 11 23:32:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:nope
Sun Feb 11 23:54:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, there is security to stop that
Sun Feb 11 23:57:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the grant commands
Sun Feb 11 23:58:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:oh yeah, but I forgot
Mon Feb 12 09:49:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:eventPrint() is not buggy :)
Mon Feb 12 09:50:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am replying to old channel talk
Mon Feb 12 09:55:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@DataMare:it is being worked on
Mon Feb 12 13:18:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone out there using the parser stuff from v22a22?
Mon Feb 12 14:28:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and this surprises you?
Mon Feb 12 20:42:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:eventReceiveDamage() or eventHealDamage()
Mon Feb 12 20:42:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:look at /lib/body.c
Mon Feb 12 20:42:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:it has all sorts of info
Mon Feb 12 20:44:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:kill mother fucking depeche mode
Mon Feb 12 20:46:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep
Mon Feb 12 20:46:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck that shit
Mon Feb 12 20:47:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the thing doing the damage
Mon Feb 12 20:48:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is a bug in call
Mon Feb 12 20:52:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't bother with the current specs
Mon Feb 12 20:52:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is being redone in a more sane fashion
Mon Feb 12 20:53:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why would you think that?
Mon Feb 12 21:08:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no
Mon Feb 12 21:10:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know where to find some useful java socket object examples?
Mon Feb 12 23:32:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's what you get with an alpha :)
Mon Feb 12 23:36:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you something bizarre to make yourself not an admin
Mon Feb 12 23:38:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:insufficient information I guess :)
Mon Feb 12 23:42:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably a security bug
Mon Feb 12 23:42:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, there is nothing wrong with your secure dir
Mon Feb 12 23:42:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just with the addguest command
Mon Feb 12 23:45:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means the object is loaded
Tue Feb 13 00:09:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the banish daemon I think
Tue Feb 13 01:05:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:time for me to sleep
Tue Feb 13 01:06:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever Misery
Tue Feb 13 01:06:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I doubt you would know what the real problems are
Tue Feb 13 01:07:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the fact of the matter is you cannot get v22a22 to work with anything mroe than simple verbs
Tue Feb 13 01:07:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Misery is a moron Falcon
Tue Feb 13 01:11:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:first, it takes days, not hours to get NM  verbs to properly fit the v22a22 verb paradigm
Tue Feb 13 01:11:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:second even if you do it right, it is impossible for certain verbs ever to work right with v22a22
Tue Feb 13 01:11:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because of a couple of major bugs in it
Tue Feb 13 01:12:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and what were those bugs you got rid of?
Tue Feb 13 01:12:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that was smart
Tue Feb 13 01:12:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 that is not fixing them
Tue Feb 13 01:12:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#2 that is actually breaking them
Tue Feb 13 01:13:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I actually could give a shit if you break your entire mud
Tue Feb 13 01:13:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whether something is used as a verb has no bearing on how often it is used
Tue Feb 13 01:14:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ohara: it is fixing it with a BFH
Tue Feb 13 01:14:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I dunno Misery, ask the people on this line I have helped
Tue Feb 13 01:14:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just with YOU would not use my lib
Tue Feb 13 01:15:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I certainly don;t with you on the people at Lima either
Tue Feb 13 01:15:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err wish
Tue Feb 13 01:16:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:may I ask what exactly the point of going through the hassle of upgrading to a driver that does not work was?
Tue Feb 13 01:18:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yet you disabled those new features? and also thought the bug fixzes were good even though it introduced worse bugs?
Tue Feb 13 01:18:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only new features are related to verbs
Tue Feb 13 01:21:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and OBS was that important you had to upgrade before you had a clue as to what you were doing?
Tue Feb 13 01:22:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek generally does not add even newer features before fixing the ones he has now
Tue Feb 13 01:22:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the disconnect in your rationalization process amazes me
Tue Feb 13 01:25:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, I am going to bed
Wed Feb 14 10:31:18 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what for?
Wed Feb 14 10:32:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that is a known bug in mudos v22a18
Wed Feb 14 10:32:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am rewriting the bug tracking ystem with a real dbms backend
Wed Feb 14 10:33:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:then you fucked up the master
Wed Feb 14 10:34:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:define won't let is
Wed Feb 14 10:35:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you know, if you tell me 'X is broken' all I can tell you is 'X must be broken'
Wed Feb 14 10:36:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and I told you that you can't update the master object with mudos v22a18
Wed Feb 14 10:41:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I know, that happened when I upgraded to solaris
Wed Feb 14 10:57:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not here
Wed Feb 14 10:58:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have way too many messages, you did not read the ones here
Wed Feb 14 11:49:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:gossip total fear
Wed Feb 14 11:50:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:netscape
Wed Feb 14 11:51:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:what is wrong with it leto?
Wed Feb 14 11:52:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:it tells you if you have email
Wed Feb 14 11:52:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:tools of the geeks
Wed Feb 14 11:53:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:la la la la la, whine bitch and moan

Wed Feb 14 11:54:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I bet you can write unreadable C code too, you are so cool
Wed Feb 14 11:56:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:leane unix leto
Wed Feb 14 11:56:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err learn
Wed Feb 14 12:20:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no exist right now
Wed Feb 14 16:32:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:depends on how you compile the driver
Wed Feb 14 20:51:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:do not use v22a22
Tue Feb 20 19:19:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with respect to a really old conversation, encre is obvious if you use Nightmare, not obvious if you don't
Tue Feb 20 19:19:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is even more obvious if you bother to read the document that says Start
Tue Feb 20 19:26:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I believe they do
Tue Feb 20 19:26:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I am not an authority on that
Tue Feb 20 20:33:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:command paths are irrelevant
Tue Feb 20 20:33:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most npc like things are done through verbs
Tue Feb 20 20:52:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what's silly?
Tue Feb 20 20:53:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:creators never make good test chars, their stats are always skewed
Tue Feb 20 20:54:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea, I have 200 pieces of unread mail
Tue Feb 20 21:00:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is it a quesiton I can answer here???
Tue Feb 20 21:05:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no selene, that makes no sense
Tue Feb 20 21:07:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that does not make ne side lockable and the other not
Tue Feb 20 21:09:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to do a little razzle dazzle, nothing complex
Tue Feb 20 21:10:52 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can;t do that
Tue Feb 20 21:12:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:evidently lockabe is associated with a side
Tue Feb 20 21:13:03 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:play with it and see what happens
Thu Feb 22 16:48:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is a victim?
Thu Feb 22 16:49:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you read theose and do what you want with them
Thu Feb 22 16:50:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean have the computer do what you mean, not what you say?>
Thu Feb 22 16:52:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:make sure you call whatever to make the path absolute before calling the efun
Thu Feb 22 22:27:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you have no idea how to code?
Thu Feb 22 22:29:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that mud better have no NM IV code in it Misery
Thu Feb 22 22:29:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for the sake of my comment, yes it does
Thu Feb 22 22:30:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Misery's mud better have none of *my* code in it
Thu Feb 22 22:31:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you heard what i said
Thu Feb 22 22:31:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you are illegally using my code, you will care
Thu Feb 22 22:32:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sure as hell would be illegal
Thu Feb 22 22:33:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the entire mudlib of Nightmare and Foundation are covered by the agreement
Thu Feb 22 22:35:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh,m you are stealing someone else's code then
Thu Feb 22 22:43:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:back to vacation!
Thu Feb 22 22:43:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:see you suckers in a week

Thu Feb 29 13:21:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is a mud conference in the twin cities at the end of july
Thu Feb 29 13:22:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically
Thu Feb 29 13:22:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Tor, that is completely imbecillic
Thu Feb 29 13:26:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not including vendor_types.h
Thu Feb 29 13:27:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu Feb 29 13:28:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try looking at what you most recently modified, since it is something you did on your end causing thaty
Thu Feb 29 13:29:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:clearly you are trying to code something that will not load
Thu Feb 29 13:32:45 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean manually load vendor_types.h?
Thu Feb 29 13:33:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean #include <vendor_types.h>?
Thu Feb 29 13:33:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:notify messages?
Thu Feb 29 13:33:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Aurelius of course you had to do that
Thu Feb 29 13:34:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea, Blitz coded that system
Thu Feb 29 17:27:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the specs exist, guess you need to implement it yourself
Thu Feb 29 17:28:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a sick world where more tmi-2 muds are up than Lima
Thu Feb 29 17:31:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any amount of inane, mindless drivel can count as folklore
Thu Feb 29 17:33:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a scarey world where people think Descartes was the dude who wrote LPC manuals and the NM mudlib
Thu Feb 29 22:12:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:kill rainforest
Thu Feb 29 22:12:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rm -rf is tres powerful
Fri Mar  1 09:17:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:v22a22 is not stable
Fri Mar  1 09:59:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:apache IMHO bites
Fri Mar  1 10:01:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I do python, but, whatever
Fri Mar  1 10:01:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are python and perl modules to allow you to write cgi securely
Fri Mar  1 10:01:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no shit
Fri Mar  1 10:04:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this machine is hit pretty heavily
Fri Mar  1 10:04:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ncsa
Fri Mar  1 10:04:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the latest
Fri Mar  1 17:57:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:chmod a+r dir
Fri Mar  1 17:57:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:actually, chmod 755 dir
Fri Mar  1 17:57:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:read access is not sufficient
Fri Mar  1 17:58:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:correct
Fri Mar  1 17:58:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:files need to be 644 andf dirs 755
Fri Mar  1 18:00:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:are you planning on using the MSQL support?
Fri Mar  1 18:01:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:beek changed the name of the package files but forgot to change the name of the .c files :)
Fri Mar  1 18:01:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:so the options.h define is DATABASE_DB not DB
Fri Mar  1 18:03:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:I am using the stuff for things like bug tracking, player trivia (like doing relational things among players, not saving players)
Fri Mar  1 18:06:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:any database access in sql will be much faster than doing the same thing in LPC
Fri Mar  1 18:06:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the only upside for LPC is straight saving objects and restoring them
Fri Mar  1 18:07:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:any data relationships will be done faster in sql
Fri Mar  1 18:10:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:the deal is this... LPC requires an object database... that is what save_object()/restore_object() are
Fri Mar  1 18:10:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:relational databases are always going to poorly capture LPC objects
Fri Mar  1 18:16:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:report it as a bug and hopefully it will be fixed before IVr3
Fri Mar  1 18:57:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:type 'id'
Fri Mar  1 18:57:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just id
Fri Mar  1 18:59:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is that your user id?
Fri Mar  1 18:59:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then the other dir you mentioned is your home
Fri Mar  1 18:59:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:type 'cd ~;chmod 755 ,'
Fri Mar  1 19:00:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err . not ,
Fri Mar  1 19:17:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:chmod 700 ~/.*
Fri Mar  1 19:17:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:log out and log back in
Fri Mar  1 19:31:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean?
Fri Mar  1 19:32:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is the people downloading dirty pictures from ftp.winternet.com
Fri Mar  1 22:05:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:change to a useful mudlib
Fri Mar  1 22:06:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Fri Mar  1 22:07:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sounds like you are bored
Fri Mar  1 22:10:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who is pissing whom off?
Fri Mar  1 22:10:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is channel_t?
Fri Mar  1 22:13:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why are you targetting people on his mud?
Fri Mar  1 22:13:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why don't you login to another mud that supports them and test it on yourself?
Fri Mar  1 22:15:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then login to Lima Bean and test it on yourself
Fri Mar  1 22:15:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't be a dweeb and bother other people
Fri Mar  1 22:16:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then why is Cire pissed that you are sending them to hise people?
Fri Mar  1 22:17:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no idea what the hell you are doing
Fri Mar  1 23:07:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:room.c
Sat Mar  2 00:07:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:woo woo!!! LPC MSQL routines are working like a charn!
Sat Mar  2 00:07:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err charm
Sat Mar  2 00:07:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, SQL
Sat Mar  2 00:11:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:miniSQL
Sat Mar  2 00:11:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a small, free RDBMS
Sat Mar  2 00:13:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:relational database management system
Sat Mar  2 00:14:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:standard query language
Sat Mar  2 00:15:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe it is, I don;t really care :)
Sat Mar  2 00:15:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what it means itself has no meaning anyways
Sat Mar  2 00:15:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a language for accessing the relations among data
Sat Mar  2 18:02:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is actually the case that you have to decide what you want death to mean
Sat Mar  2 18:02:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such thing as a 'pray' command
Sat Mar  2 18:03:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then code something that calls eventRevive()
Sat Mar  2 18:03:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:do you want other players to revive the dead?  Do you want to be lame and code yet another church where people pray?  Do you want to do somehting no one has thought of?
Sat Mar  2 18:06:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever tickles your pickle
Sat Mar  2 18:20:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you have dorks like Misery opening muds just to be on the admin channel
Sat Mar  2 18:22:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not interested in hacks Nippie
Sat Mar  2 18:22:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it will be done the right way, and the right way is not possible yet
Sat Mar  2 18:22:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has to be a hack Leto
Sat Mar  2 18:23:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I must caution you again against talking on things you are clueless about Leto... this is not NM code, it is MudOS command parisng
Sat Mar  2 18:25:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Leto, you are the one with that habit
Sat Mar  2 18:26:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I piss you off and it gives you a license to blabber about anything? cool
Sat Mar  2 18:28:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is being held up by driver releases
Sat Mar  2 18:28:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as far as I can see, there is only one major bug I need to wait on for IVr2.4
Sat Mar  2 18:29:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wrong arguments getting passed to parser callback functions by the driver
Sat Mar  2 18:29:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:should be fixedin v22a24 I hope
Sat Mar  2 18:29:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:msql support is not needed to release NM
Sat Mar  2 18:29:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I have msql support working in v22a23
Sat Mar  2 18:29:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with msql support, yes, there were several problems
Sat Mar  2 18:30:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek changed some file names on me
Sat Mar  2 18:30:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also...
Sat Mar  2 18:30:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:need to manually #define the proper INCL in database_db.h
Sat Mar  2 18:31:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek forgot that edit_source -options runs after edit_source -configure
Sat Mar  2 18:31:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the right INCL never gets defined
Sat Mar  2 18:31:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and finally, change two instances of const0n to const0 in database_db.c
Sat Mar  2 18:31:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that should do it
Sat Mar  2 18:33:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for the most part yes, I was more modeling on a simplistic dblib
Sat Mar  2 18:33:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it seems to be working cool... I have a very simple interactive sql system for NM
Sat Mar  2 18:34:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:database permissions are still kinda tricky
Sat Mar  2 18:34:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no benchmarks, but I am damn certain any complex relations will be infinitely faster using msql
Sat Mar  2 18:35:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also huge mappings (like bug tracking systems) are much more efficiently stored in a database where they can be accessed on an as needed basis
Sat Mar  2 18:35:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, for things like storing player data, you still wnat to use save_object()/restore_object()
Sat Mar  2 18:35:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you only want to use the database stuff for where you want to get complex data relations
Sat Mar  2 18:36:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, all the people who play your mud from winternet.com to check for doubles
Sat Mar  2 18:38:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh yes, make sure you change the define to PACKAGE_DATABASE_DB and make database_db.c include database_db.h instead of db.h
Sat Mar  2 18:39:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh
Sat Mar  2 18:39:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that will work too :)
Sat Mar  2 18:41:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is here
Sat Mar  2 18:43:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, there is a db server and efuns now
Sat Mar  2 18:44:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I wrote a database efun package to interface with the MSQL rdbms package
Sat Mar  2 18:44:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek integrated it in tighter with MudOS than I had done
Sat Mar  2 18:45:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but he made a couple of mistakes... which would be expected for the first try at full integration
Sat Mar  2 18:45:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially since this package is the first mudos package to try to interface from build.MudOS with third party packages which may or may not exist
Sat Mar  2 19:43:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:wrong line :)
Sat Mar  2 21:39:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:drop it
Sat Mar  2 23:08:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:that is not a proper path
Sat Mar  2 23:08:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:it is not on ftp.imaginary.com
Sat Mar  2 23:18:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:some interface thing
Sat Mar  2 23:22:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there was a change in mudos
Sat Mar  2 23:24:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Sat Mar  2 23:26:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Sat Mar  2 23:27:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:deal
Sat Mar  2 23:31:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:specify what is meant
Sat Mar  2 23:33:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:users.c... move() { return user::move(); }
Sat Mar  2 23:34:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:override the function then call the one you want called
Sat Mar  2 23:35:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever, I have no idea what exactly you wsnt
Sun Mar  3 11:23:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you have an 'i player' command?
Sun Mar  3 11:23:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just use scan
Sun Mar  3 11:24:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you had to rewrite i to see the inventory of other people, and scan gives more info
Sun Mar  3 11:27:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am just talking about on I3... Earth is the only TMI-2 derivative I did not count
Sun Mar  3 11:30:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tmi is not like anything available for mudos
Sun Mar  3 11:30:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so that is a bad comparison :)
Sun Mar  3 11:31:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that hardly makes it anything like Discworld :)
Sun Mar  3 11:32:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not like anything itself :)
Sun Mar  3 11:32:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, all of the MudOS ;libs are quite different
Sun Mar  3 11:34:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:s/imaginative/twisted
Sun Mar  3 11:35:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:run it on any 3.* driver now :)
Sun Mar  3 11:37:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the slower driver with fewer features? :)
Sun Mar  3 11:38:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:DGD is so bare bones as to be nearly useless
Sun Mar  3 11:39:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless you intend to do something commercial, then you have a hell of a lot of writing on your hands
Sun Mar  3 12:00:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any examples of the socket class in java?
Sun Mar  3 12:02:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't see any
Sun Mar  3 12:13:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:writing a damn socket object bites with Java
Sun Mar  3 12:19:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:type 'mudlist -m nightmare'
Sun Mar  3 12:19:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the obvious exits are in the long descs
Sun Mar  3 12:20:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there just are 0 examples of how to use the socket stuff
Sun Mar  3 12:21:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:obvious exits are listed in the long descriptions
Sun Mar  3 12:23:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever :)
Sun Mar  3 12:23:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you all are absolutely right, I have no idea what I am talking about with respect to the code I wrote
Sun Mar  3 12:26:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare IVr2.3 does include obvious exits in the long description
Sun Mar  3 12:27:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Mar  3 12:27:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:should I repeat myself yet again?
Sun Mar  3 12:27:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare IVr2.3 does include obvious exits in the long description
Sun Mar  3 12:28:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to specify which exits are obvious
Sun Mar  3 12:28:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is SetObviousExits() not obvious enough to you? or did I write the documentation in a foreign language?
Sun Mar  3 12:30:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what the fuck else do you expect SetObviousExits() to mean?  make the exits obvious just sometimes?
Sun Mar  3 12:30:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the standard puts it in the long and the short
Sun Mar  3 12:31:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, I am on NM
Sun Mar  3 12:31:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who said it did anything like NM3?
Sun Mar  3 12:32:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I'll be damned if you people don't have the narrowest fucking minds on earth
Sun Mar  3 12:33:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetObviousExitsJustLikeTheyWereOnSomeOtherMudlibANDiFtHEYdOnOTaPPEARtHISwAYtHENtHEYaREnOToBVIOUSeXITS()
Sun Mar  3 12:34:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:piss off Spadex and go use tmi-2
Sun Mar  3 12:35:52 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:suits me fine
Sun Mar  3 12:36:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:less inane crap per day being asked of me the better
Sun Mar  3 12:37:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the bottom line is don't fucking insult the documentation unless you have put at least 5 minutes of thought into the criticism
Sun Mar  3 12:37:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if you can explain how SetObviousExits() can possibly mean not setting the obvious exits, I will apologize profusely
Sun Mar  3 12:44:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:don't try suicide
Sun Mar  3 14:21:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Selene that was a damn nsane thing to do
Sun Mar  3 14:25:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gillette tortures animals!
Mon Mar  4 21:23:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:does anyone know the ascii values of the characters the server sends on connect using the telnet protocol?
Mon Mar  4 21:24:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:can anyone hear me?
Mon Mar  4 21:27:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Mon Mar  4 21:34:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:code the monster right
Tue Mar  5 09:49:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you coded them wrng?
Tue Mar  5 09:50:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:code them right
Tue Mar  5 09:59:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't have to do a damn thing
Tue Mar  5 10:00:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they die in the normal course of combat when you do sufficient damage to them
Tue Mar  5 10:01:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you only win if you damage them enough
Tue Mar  5 10:01:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if they damage you enough, you die
Tue Mar  5 10:52:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not on this line
Tue Mar  5 10:53:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:leto wake up!!! 
Tue Mar  5 10:54:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:look at this window
Tue Mar  5 19:04:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone have any idea how to construct an image in Java?
Tue Mar  5 19:29:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know where some good java docs are?  Not that crap on the sun h0me page
Tue Mar  5 19:54:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you probably read them
Tue Mar  5 19:55:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never did more than one draft
Tue Mar  5 19:55:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:old ones are as good as new ones with only one version existing
Tue Mar  5 19:55:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just want a quesiton answered
Tue Mar  5 19:55:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi
Tue Mar  5 19:56:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is only ONE set of LPC documentation, I never wrote a second
Tue Mar  5 19:56:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want an answer NOW :)
Tue Mar  5 19:57:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are worded for newbie coders
Tue Mar  5 19:57:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and anyone modifying the wording is in violation of my copyright
Tue Mar  5 19:58:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want to know how to create an image object when I have no instance of an applet object lying around
Tue Mar  5 20:00:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:would you rather Hitler?
Tue Mar  5 20:03:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:given a URL, how do I instantiate an Image object in Java without access to an applet object instance
Tue Mar  5 20:04:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the normal way is applet_instance.getImage(url)
Tue Mar  5 20:04:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have no applet instance in scope
Tue Mar  5 20:04:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those sun docs say to do the wrong thing
Tue Mar  5 20:05:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they say do Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(url)
Tue Mar  5 20:05:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unfortunately, there is no getImage() method in the toolkit class
Tue Mar  5 20:05:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has nothing to do with what browser you have
Tue Mar  5 20:06:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no shjit DK?
Tue Mar  5 20:13:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's why I want the answer to my java question :)
Tue Mar  5 20:33:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:#define NO_WIZARDS in options.h
Tue Mar  5 20:34:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:try using your old options.h
Tue Mar  5 20:37:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not only are they lame enough to use it, even lamer to overide it
Tue Mar  5 20:37:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:think no wizards rulz
Tue Mar  5 20:38:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:because tmi-2 is lame
Tue Mar  5 20:39:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:any time you can avoid a call to quer() is a plus
Tue Mar  5 20:45:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:exit means nothing
Tue Mar  5 20:45:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:you are not supposed to willy-nilly add commands with the nm mudlib
Tue Mar  5 20:46:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:go exit is not valid, go out is the closest
Tue Mar  5 20:47:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:no you cannot do that
Tue Mar  5 20:47:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:not without breaking the command structure
Tue Mar  5 20:47:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:in other words you *can* do that but your are not *supposed* to do that
Tue Mar  5 22:34:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:Java java java
Tue Mar  5 22:40:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:don't add actions
Tue Mar  5 22:40:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:don't use reset
Tue Mar  5 22:41:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:add_action() is absolutely forbidden in the NM lib
Tue Mar  5 22:42:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you can code it
Tue Mar  5 22:42:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you just don't add the action, players already have the action
Tue Mar  5 22:43:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:you are using an alpha mudlib, that is not documented
Tue Mar  5 22:44:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:encre
Tue Mar  5 22:45:53 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:what is worded strangely?
Tue Mar  5 22:46:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:reboot the mud
Tue Mar  5 23:11:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:die die die
Wed Mar  6 09:45:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try looking at the inherit list
Wed Mar  6 09:45:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably not though
Wed Mar  6 10:09:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is no such thing as v22
Wed Mar  6 10:10:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:and all MudOS releases are at ftp.imaginary.com or they do not exist
Wed Mar  6 10:10:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:figured he could not possibly mean that since it is on the ftp site :)
Wed Mar  6 10:12:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:there is no such thing as v22
Wed Mar  6 10:13:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:no such thing as v2.2 either
Wed Mar  6 10:14:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:that source is not reliable
Wed Mar  6 10:14:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:v21.6 is fine
Wed Mar  6 10:14:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I never said that
Wed Mar  6 10:14:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I NEVER suggest v22 to anyone
Wed Mar  6 10:14:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:Beek never said that, I doubt he recommends the v22 alphas to anyone
Wed Mar  6 10:15:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:v21.4 is the earliest
Wed Mar  6 10:18:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:if you don't know, you have not read your docs or used our mud at all
Wed Mar  6 10:19:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:or you are using NM 3 and don't use the parser :)
Wed Mar  6 10:19:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I would never in a million years have recommended any NM 3 mud to use v22a*
Wed Mar  6 10:19:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:NEVER use alphas on a production mud
Wed Mar  6 10:19:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:of course, there are exceptions :)
Wed Mar  6 10:40:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I am tired of answering questions I put in the directions
Wed Mar  6 10:40:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:flux, that is bullshit
Wed Mar  6 10:41:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't know at this point whether I should waste my time
Wed Mar  6 10:42:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have gotten 2 responses saying they might come to my last query
Wed Mar  6 10:42:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Flux: Nightmare suffers from a lack of documentation
Wed Mar  6 10:42:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not suffer from quality of documentation that exists
Wed Mar  6 10:43:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and what was I complaining about?
Wed Mar  6 10:43:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I was complaining about people who did not read directions
Wed Mar  6 10:43:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that implies the documentation for the problem in question exists
Wed Mar  6 10:44:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for example, people getting started missing the doc that says Start
Wed Mar  6 10:45:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have seen that happen a lot
Wed Mar  6 10:46:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and people asking for the mudlib without docs because the docs take up so much space
Wed Mar  6 10:47:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trying to write LPMud 2.4.5 rooms
Wed Mar  6 10:48:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I want it to
Wed Mar  6 10:48:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I plan on it
Wed Mar  6 10:48:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just do not like everyone's attitude 'You make it work and tell us what it is'
Wed Mar  6 10:49:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically
Wed Mar  6 10:50:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:determine what you want to see happen
Wed Mar  6 10:50:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:come up with a thing to do and sponsor it
Wed Mar  6 10:50:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can find the utilities and do all the leg work
Wed Mar  6 10:52:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Minneapolis, MN
Wed Mar  6 10:53:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the point is to get together and learn something
Wed Mar  6 10:55:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:help me come up with an agenda... I am proposing that the theme be the affect of local laws on international muds
Wed Mar  6 10:58:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:presentations on topics of interest
Wed Mar  6 10:59:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:'How to migrate your NM 3 mud to intermud'
Wed Mar  6 11:03:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don;t want suggestions on topics, I want people saying they are going to present topics
Wed Mar  6 11:04:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now I have a lot of people saying they will present papers if I give them a topic
Wed Mar  6 11:06:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, migrating NM 3 libs to intermud 3 is something you kow about
Wed Mar  6 11:07:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cool :) mail me a proposal so I have it on record :)
Wed Mar  6 11:08:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would not be a topic of interest to most people on *this* line
Wed Mar  6 11:08:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are already here
Wed Mar  6 11:08:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:better yet... it should be part of a larger presentation on intermud 3
Wed Mar  6 11:09:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that you do in coordnation with someone else
Wed Mar  6 11:09:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you can do the part on moving NM3 muds
Wed Mar  6 18:36:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on NM it is realy easy, just read the document on making doors
Wed Mar  6 18:38:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I am not telling you to do that
Wed Mar  6 18:38:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you create two rooms and you create a door
Wed Mar  6 18:39:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:linking what?
Wed Mar  6 18:40:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't use the create command
Wed Mar  6 18:40:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:use good old ed
Wed Mar  6 18:42:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Darkman, he is not using your mudlib
Wed Mar  6 18:43:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes the doc has an example
Wed Mar  6 18:43:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the downside is if he gets too fancy, some of the more esoteric pieces are changing in IVr4
Wed Mar  6 18:43:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:2.4
Wed Mar  6 18:44:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/Creators/Doors
Wed Mar  6 18:56:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call cheesebrain->SetSkill("whatever", level, class)
Wed Mar  6 18:57:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only 7 other muds use tmi-2, and you are the only one using your release on this line :)
Wed Mar  6 18:58:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:1.2
Wed Mar  6 19:00:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:call player->func(args)
Wed Mar  6 19:02:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what I told you they were hte first time aorund :)
Wed Mar  6 19:02:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:skill name, skill level to set to, class to set to
Wed Mar  6 19:12:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:class 12 is nonsensical
Wed Mar  6 19:13:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:classes are 1 -5
Wed Mar  6 21:44:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:woo woo, got it so you can get to nightmare through the web now :)
Wed Mar  6 21:55:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you know it is a bad day when you mean to type 'kill -9 4218' and you type kill -9 '4228' and 4228 is your shell process
Thu Mar  7 14:45:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:answering stupid questions
Thu Mar  7 14:47:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:asking a bunch of coders is not the way to get that info
Thu Mar  7 14:48:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not say you wer e not
Thu Mar  7 14:48:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my point is that players are the best ones to ask that question
Thu Mar  7 14:49:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, if you are on this line, chances are Jester can't give you what you don;t already have
Thu Mar  7 14:50:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so we are back to my point, you need to ask players, not coders
Thu Mar  7 14:51:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and these people are evidently trying to do on their own muds what they think muds are missing... to get at what is truly missing on muds, you need to ask people currently involved with playing the game
Thu Mar  7 14:52:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:piss off Zharradan
Thu Mar  7 14:52:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a survey of the wrong people is not casual conversation
Thu Mar  7 14:53:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why is it I can't point out the fucking obvious without gettin shit from dorks like Zharradan and Nightengale?
Thu Mar  7 14:55:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who is doing that?
Thu Mar  7 17:56:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to make my life miserable
Thu Mar  7 17:58:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are from one of them germanic countries
Thu Mar  7 17:59:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:America, America ueber alles
Thu Mar  7 18:00:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dutch people are germanic
Thu Mar  7 18:01:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then it is not like calling an american canadian or mexican
Thu Mar  7 18:01:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:cause americans are not canadian or mexican
Thu Mar  7 18:01:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are not germanic either
Thu Mar  7 18:01:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am Celtic
Thu Mar  7 18:01:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:many are african in descent
Thu Mar  7 18:02:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:many are also italian and oriental
Thu Mar  7 18:02:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the USA has no ethnicity
Thu Mar  7 18:03:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, right miss dutchie
Thu Mar  7 18:05:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so like, I start hotjava from the sun cd-rom... and the thing gpf's immediately
Thu Mar  7 18:05:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:general protection fault
Thu Mar  7 18:10:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmmm... javadoc is cool
Thu Mar  7 18:13:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Monique, you are invisible
Thu Mar  7 20:06:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:inherit LIB_SENTIENT
Thu Mar  7 20:07:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably because you are calling npc::create();
Thu Mar  7 20:08:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are inheriting a different object, therefore you need to refer to the object you inherited
Thu Mar  7 20:08:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sentient::create();
Thu Mar  7 20:18:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sentient inherits npc
Thu Mar  7 20:18:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you only therefore should inherit sentient
Thu Mar  7 20:21:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like from an errors?
Thu Mar  7 20:22:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I mean, what sort of trace are you wanting?
Thu Mar  7 20:23:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:previous_object(-1) is always a quick hack
Thu Mar  7 20:23:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should check your error log first
Fri Mar  8 10:01:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the LPMud timeline
Fri Mar  8 22:40:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Namesi you should not be formatting output
Fri Mar  8 23:21:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't work around alpha bugs
Fri Mar  8 23:21:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you wait for a proper fix
Fri Mar  8 23:21:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:most all bugs in NM IVr2.3 are related to the driver parsing syste,
Fri Mar  8 23:22:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever floats your boat
Fri Mar  8 23:24:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:going net dead for a minute
Fri Mar  8 23:31:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that did not work
Fri Mar  8 23:31:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:part 1 did not work
Fri Mar  8 23:31:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ftp.imaginary.com
Fri Mar  8 23:42:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all versions of mudos are at ftp.imaginary.com
Fri Mar  8 23:42:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the mudos release site
Sat Mar  9 10:54:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if they are not dying, then an error is generated, and it will tell you why in the error logs
Sat Mar  9 10:55:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:slow_shutdown() is called
Sat Mar  9 11:23:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would be logged to an error log matching the error causing the not dying
Sat Mar  9 11:23:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are three types of error, runtime, compile time, and caught
Sat Mar  9 11:24:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:runtime go to /log/runtime
Sat Mar  9 11:24:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:catch /log/catch
Sat Mar  9 11:24:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and compile time to log files for the individual creators or system dirs
Sat Mar  9 11:25:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:define don;t die
Sat Mar  9 11:26:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that makes no sense Leto :)
Sat Mar  9 11:26:38 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what does it mean that it does not die?
Sat Mar  9 11:27:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Leto, leave it alone, you have no idea what he means, and if you are right, it is just an accident
Sat Mar  9 11:27:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am asking specifically how is it not dying
Sat Mar  9 11:28:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you cannot use a term in its definition
Sat Mar  9 11:29:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when I ask you how it does not die, you cannot say it does not die
Sat Mar  9 11:29:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is it not doing
Sat Mar  9 11:29:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and don;t use the word die or any synonym thereof
Sat Mar  9 11:30:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:are you sure it is not calling eventDie()?
Sat Mar  9 11:32:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and this happens across the board?
Sat Mar  9 11:32:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you must have made some change to body.c which prevents it from dying
Sat Mar  9 11:33:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:depends on the change you made
Sat Mar  9 11:34:32 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you are almost certainly not reading the error logs right
Sat Mar  9 11:35:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, but I can tell you what you are looking for
Sat Mar  9 11:35:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grep kills /log/runtime
Sat Mar  9 11:36:38 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok search the catch log
Sat Mar  9 11:37:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that's right
Sat Mar  9 11:37:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the trace mentions eventDie()
Sat Mar  9 11:37:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so you did two things wrong here...
Sat Mar  9 11:38:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 you relied on a call to represent real happenings
Sat Mar  9 11:38:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to put debug lines in code and see what is really happening and not rely on call
Sat Mar  9 11:38:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because eventDie() takes 1 or 0 arguments
Sat Mar  9 11:38:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:calling it with no args will work, with 1 arg is not working
Sat Mar  9 11:39:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:second thing is you did not read yourt catch log right
Sat Mar  9 11:39:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:now, to fix that, just make the right sub-dirs of /save/kills
Sat Mar  9 11:44:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right now you need to do it manually, like I just told you to do :)
Sat Mar  9 11:45:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or do it from the mud
Sat Mar  9 11:45:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have mkdir on the mud :)
Sat Mar  9 11:45:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm, not with multuple args thogh :)
Sat Mar  9 13:12:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not matter
Sat Mar  9 13:12:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless you have exiting properties already set
Sat Mar  9 13:12:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetProperties() wipes out any existing properties
Sat Mar  9 13:15:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what would an exiting property be?
Sat Mar  9 13:16:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:might as well have asked me if I meant exementing property
Sat Mar  9 13:16:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I said wipes out existinng properties
Sat Mar  9 13:18:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:kill pid
Sat Mar  9 13:19:03 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zharradan, this is the code channel, try to keep your useless blather on intergossip
Sat Mar  9 13:19:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you either need to be logged into the same machine or on the mud
Sat Mar  9 13:19:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:otherwise you have a security problem :)
Sat Mar  9 13:21:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:root should give you access to the machine
Sat Mar  9 13:21:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then why don;t you have access to your account?
Sat Mar  9 13:22:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is Eterna Server an LPC processing server? or a different vriant?
Sat Mar  9 13:23:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, welcome to I3 :)
Sat Mar  9 13:23:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you can write scripts to do whatever bizarre things you like
Sat Mar  9 13:24:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would be a tricky one though
Sat Mar  9 13:33:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where do you see whitespace?
Sat Mar  9 13:33:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:"" is no chars
Sat Mar  9 13:34:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just use the rteurn value from GetObviousExits()
Sat Mar  9 13:34:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the whitespace comes from the line that outputs the obvious exits
Sat Mar  9 17:34:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it defaults to mud port -10
Sat Mar  9 17:35:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:children by the millions scream for alex chilton
Sat Mar  9 18:06:38 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in Java, can you override a public method so that it is private?
Sat Mar  9 18:10:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think args and name are the signature, I need to check I guess
Sat Mar  9 18:13:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:private GI Joe() thows aTantrum {
Sat Mar  9 18:23:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did :)
Sat Mar  9 18:55:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is proper
Sat Mar  9 18:56:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are adding two mappings, not adding their elements
Sat Mar  9 18:56:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Mar  9 18:57:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:leto's answer would create ([ ([ "test" : 3 ]), ([ "test" : 9 ]) ])
Sat Mar  9 18:57:45 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need a["test"] += b["test"]
Sat Mar  9 18:59:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, just because Leto was being short, not because he was really wrong
Sat Mar  9 19:00:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Cire, you mean it is kind of a pain to have a mapping be a mapping? :)
Sat Mar  9 20:18:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks for that local conversation
Sat Mar  9 20:31:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the bottom line is that they were on the SAME mud
Sat Mar  9 20:32:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't
Sat Mar  9 20:35:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, those would be stupid admins
Sat Mar  9 20:35:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or ones administering a 56k link network
Sat Mar  9 20:36:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:also i laugh at people who call anything a waste of bandwidth
Sat Mar  9 20:37:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using bandwidth is not wasting it
Sat Mar  9 20:44:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do, but I am too busy to go make it available right now
Sat Mar  9 20:45:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:besides, coding up something is not that hard
Sat Mar  9 20:45:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just print out the fields in author_stats() and domain_stats()
Sat Mar  9 20:54:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you mean like author stats and domain stats?
Sat Mar  9 20:55:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:I am Descartes :)
Sat Mar  9 20:56:03 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:the great one died 300 years ago
Sat Mar  9 20:56:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@Nightmare:thank you :) i know some might not agree
Sat Mar  9 20:58:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thank you :)
Sat Mar  9 21:01:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Hanzou, those fiels are not meant to be edited by hand
Sat Mar  9 21:02:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@Nightmare:how?
Sat Mar  9 21:05:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:author_stats() and domain_stats() have very little with the old wizlist stuff
Sat Mar  9 21:38:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sat Mar  9 22:27:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like Rassilon said, you determine it in master.c to answer your original question
Sat Mar  9 22:29:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your original question was how you prevent things from loading in ./tmp
Sat Mar  9 22:31:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I guess the answer there would be 'Who gives a shit?"
Sat Mar  9 22:36:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how pinheads can dance on an angel?
Sat Mar  9 22:36:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err how many
Sat Mar  9 22:38:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no need to pick on people
Sat Mar  9 22:40:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who did that?
Sat Mar  9 22:41:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:muds should be senfining $N
Sat Mar  9 22:41:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fucker of the day
Sat Mar  9 23:13:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know how to set any of the freaking modifiers in the new crap cc-mode that comes with emacs these days?
Sun Mar 10 10:01:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a creative guy
Mon Mar 18 11:54:54 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sharing the world with slaughtered pigs!
Sat Mar 23 00:13:43 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:java java java
Sat Mar 23 18:09:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:str = oldstr[0..x-1] + substr + oldstr[x+1..];
Sat Mar 23 18:11:53 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:beek answered what you wanted
Sat Mar 23 18:12:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mine and Belal's answeres were needlessly complicated
Sat Mar 23 18:13:18 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is off of I3 for reasons ranging frma fundamental believe that intermud is stupid to a question of whether I intend actually to have anything to do with I3 any more period
Sat Mar 23 18:14:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, he also said sr[x..x-1] = "blah" not to replace it
Sat Mar 23 18:32:42 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am gone from muds indefinitely... DO NOT MAIL ME QUESTIONS
Sat Mar 23 18:34:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I find no enjoyment here right now
Sun Mar 24 23:23:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this line is certainly not the place for that question
Sun Mar 24 23:23:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Sun Mar 24 23:24:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this line is ONLY for code related discussion
Sun Mar 24 23:25:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then ask the questioninstead of asking if peple are out there
Sun Mar 24 23:26:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is there a problem with me expecting you to adhere to what this lineis for?
Sun Mar 24 23:27:45 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no need to tell me what the small stuff is
Wed Mar 27 18:01:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, it actually needs some tweaking to work on solaris
Wed Mar 27 18:02:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:despite the propaganda, perl code is not necessarily portable
Tue Apr  2 08:44:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:MudOS changed word wrap support
Tue Apr  2 23:18:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mud is dead
Tue Apr  2 23:22:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetExits()
Tue Apr  2 23:24:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't put the .c
Tue Apr  2 23:24:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course, lounge.c has to load
Tue Apr  2 23:24:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I actually doubt whether having the .c makes any difference
Tue Apr  2 23:24:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would bet your lounge simply does not load
Tue Apr  2 23:24:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hi :)
Tue Apr  2 23:25:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am fine
Tue Apr  2 23:25:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not too keen on accepting cres who have their own muds up
Tue Apr  2 23:49:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:SetItems()
Tue Apr  2 23:49:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is documentation on this stuff :)
Tue Apr  2 23:55:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this line is for code
Wed Apr  3 21:47:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means specifically ""
Wed Apr  3 22:14:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, it was not, and it told you why :)
Thu Apr  4 08:54:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the function names are no longer than NM 3 ones, in fact shorter
Thu Apr  4 08:54:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:excepting events, which simly have the word event preprended
Thu Apr  4 08:56:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thank you
Thu Apr  4 12:32:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:muds be quiet lately
Thu Apr  4 12:32:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they must be dying
Thu Apr  4 12:33:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPMud is dead :)
Thu Apr  4 12:34:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Enkil: you download it,read the directions, and hope it works
Thu Apr  4 12:34:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I generally avoid this line
Thu Apr  4 12:35:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just felt like expressing my opinion on the future of LPMud
Thu Apr  4 12:35:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Enkil, then I point you tothe little section that says I do not support the ftpd
Thu Apr  4 12:35:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am going to write a Java system
Thu Apr  4 12:36:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one
Thu Apr  4 12:40:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should do it in Java
Thu Apr  4 12:40:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:multi-htreaded support, and better security design
Thu Apr  4 12:41:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java runs fine without the web
Thu Apr  4 12:41:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Java exists for portability
Thu Apr  4 12:41:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... though, there is no SunOS support
Thu Apr  4 12:42:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:go figure
Thu Apr  4 12:42:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one disputes my LPMud is dead claim? >:)
Thu Apr  4 12:43:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, most of the buffoons doing java mud stuff don't have a clue what they are doing
Thu Apr  4 12:44:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not know python had thread support
Thu Apr  4 12:44:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is supposed to be the last weekenmd of july
Thu Apr  4 12:44:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I have gotten NO ONE registering
Thu Apr  4 12:45:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:*nod* if nothing else, it will be a fun gathering
Thu Apr  4 12:46:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nice lst hoorah for LPMud :)
Thu Apr  4 12:47:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, I intend to finish NM if it kills me
Thu Apr  4 12:47:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the next NM release will come out when the bugs in MudOS are fixed
Thu Apr  4 12:48:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i said the end of march because I did not think it would take 4 months to fix this mudos bug
Thu Apr  4 12:48:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Python does not have the security manager concept of Java
Thu Apr  4 12:49:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:docs are part of the final release
Thu Apr  4 12:49:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:port lima to python? :)
Thu Apr  4 12:49:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:try loading a room from a remote host with pythn :)
Thu Apr  4 12:50:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I don't know, I just know my next mud project is Java not python :)
Thu Apr  4 12:51:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one cares about the security holes :)
Thu Apr  4 12:53:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java has such huge buy in... if you are going to go for smething else, you have to find something more secure, and there is no such thing
Thu Apr  4 12:54:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC does not load remote objects
Thu Apr  4 12:54:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java has a potential of changing the way we do software development
Thu Apr  4 12:54:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the hypeis deserved
Thu Apr  4 12:55:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how am I going to load /std/body from lima bean over to here?
Thu Apr  4 12:56:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:remote function calls are not the problem
Thu Apr  4 12:56:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am talking about storing class A on one machine and loading it on another
Thu Apr  4 12:57:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that is not right Rust
Thu Apr  4 12:57:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sending the source code and compiling wuld be outrageously inefficient
Thu Apr  4 12:58:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:correct
Thu Apr  4 12:58:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:by the way, i think Java is remarkably LPC like :)
Thu Apr  4 13:00:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like...?
Thu Apr  4 13:01:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Java model is what is impotant
Thu Apr  4 13:01:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not the language itself
Thu Apr  4 13:01:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and corba is simply a communication protocol
Thu Apr  4 13:01:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java-like languae + corba is the answer
Thu Apr  4 13:03:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to aim at your current developer base
Thu Apr  4 13:03:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is what will make Java successful
Thu Apr  4 13:04:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:protected works fine
Thu Apr  4 13:04:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the exception handling is not complex
Thu Apr  4 13:04:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only difference from Python is minor
Thu Apr  4 13:05:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java speed bites
Thu Apr  4 13:05:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, if protected is not working, it is a bug and not a feature of the language
Thu Apr  4 13:09:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java is not a product of advertising
Thu Apr  4 13:09:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Java marketing staff was just two people until recently
Thu Apr  4 13:10:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is not a lot of marketing by industry standards
Thu Apr  4 13:10:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:at any rate, I am headed to JavaOne in May
Thu Apr  4 13:10:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Sunis solving a problem no one else has solved
Thu Apr  4 13:10:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the source of the hype
Thu Apr  4 13:11:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh yeah, by the way, I am going to be a regular columnist for the Java Developers Journal :)
Thu Apr  4 13:12:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which language?
Thu Apr  4 13:13:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no they do not
Thu Apr  4 13:14:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not to the degree of sphisticationof the Java model
Thu Apr  4 13:14:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is tremendously important
Thu Apr  4 13:14:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Perl does not handle the human race well
Thu Apr  4 13:15:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rust, ou have never shown a big slant on Python, now, have you?
Thu Apr  4 13:15:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do a LOT with Java
Thu Apr  4 13:15:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I do script programming in python
Thu Apr  4 13:16:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rust, I use 10 languages in one day commonly
Thu Apr  4 13:16:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:already today I have worked in Java, Perl, C++, SQL
Thu Apr  4 13:17:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh yeah, that LPC thing too
Thu Apr  4 13:18:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:pet peeve number 1 of *Java* mud people... they want to build "drivers"
Thu Apr  4 13:18:32 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why redo LPMud in Java?
Thu Apr  4 13:18:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why redo LPMud in Java?
Thu Apr  4 13:21:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh, well, read issue #1 of the Java Developers Journal for my thoughts on Java Mud :)
Thu Apr  4 13:22:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, and it will not be on newsstands until next month
Thu Apr  4 13:24:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:horizontally
Thu Apr  4 23:25:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:already saw the episode
Thu Apr  4 23:26:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what happens see, is...
Thu Apr  4 23:26:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:...and the President...
Thu Apr  4 23:26:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is an awesome episode
Thu Apr  4 23:27:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Delenn has the best line I have heard on B5 ever in it
Thu Apr  4 23:27:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:muds are a most profund waste of time
Thu Apr  4 23:27:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:want some clues? :)
Thu Apr  4 23:28:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I want to finish what I started
Thu Apr  4 23:28:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:life, by the way, is a huge waste of time
Thu Apr  4 23:30:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare V is almost certain to be the last release of the NM mudlib
Thu Apr  4 23:31:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:muds raised mine... I got my best GPA the semester I mudded
Thu Apr  4 23:34:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably because it made me use my time better
Thu Apr  4 23:53:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:delenn's line?
Thu Apr  4 23:56:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how many seasons are there supposed to be?
Fri Apr  5 17:53:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone here ever been to China?
Fri Apr  5 21:28:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this conversation is in really poor taste
Fri Apr  5 21:35:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:guys who think good sex is a nocturnal emission
Fri Apr  5 21:36:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Caiaphus grow up or log out
Fri Apr  5 21:38:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah fuckhead, I am stupid
Fri Apr  5 21:39:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reason #25 for the fall of LPMuds... the intellect of mud people has dropped a thousand fold in the last 2 years
Fri Apr  5 21:40:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatecer
Fri Apr  5 21:41:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would damn near guarantee I am smarrter than you Caiaphas
Fri Apr  5 21:41:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sucks to be you
Fri Apr  5 21:43:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am damn happy and thankful I am me :)
Fri Apr  5 21:45:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that statement was a reference to me bozo
Fri Apr  5 21:45:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it sucks, I need to lose weight
Fri Apr  5 21:47:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I prefer chocolate chip
Fri Apr  5 23:08:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, it is an sefun
Sat Apr  6 16:39:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who all has gotten mail from those hijack.org fucks?
Sat Apr  6 16:40:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I emailed the postmaster of their provider and and spammed them with 200 emails back
Sat Apr  6 16:41:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone who sends me junk email gets a program called fuckyou.pl in my hme dir run on them
Sat Apr  6 16:41:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:normally I mail them back their own junk mail like 30 times
Sat Apr  6 16:42:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this particular piece, I got three copies of though
Sat Apr  6 16:42:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I had it mail them 200 times with a nice commentary at the top ebery 30 seconds
Sat Apr  6 16:43:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:with 200 mails, they have to sort through those 200 :)
Sat Apr  6 16:45:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people spam you a lot leto? :)
Sat Apr  6 20:33:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:%^GREEN%^FUCK%^RED%^ YOU :)
Sat Apr  6 20:35:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever
Mon Apr  8 00:11:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any of you ever been to china?
Mon Apr  8 00:13:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I asked if anyone had been there, not who had not been there
Mon Apr  8 00:13:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are singly endowed with the ability to syphon off bandwidth
Mon Apr  8 00:15:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why do you guys have to act like 12 year olds?
Mon Apr  8 00:15:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:using more than one hand with a weapon
Mon Apr  8 00:15:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wkeep it to yourself
Mon Apr  8 00:16:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if it pleases you :)
Mon Apr  8 00:17:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this line is not for your hormones
Mon Apr  8 00:17:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:grow up or take it to IRC, but leave it off here
Mon Apr  8 00:18:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mv
Mon Apr  8 00:20:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, how do you shut Unverseman up?
Mon Apr  8 00:21:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not a major challenge :)
Mon Apr  8 00:22:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:security with UID's is impossible :)
Mon Apr  8 00:22:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:don't bother me son
Mon Apr  8 00:23:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know, I did Rust, but that is a detail we don't need right now
Mon Apr  8 00:23:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:privs == simplistic uid's
Mon Apr  8 00:24:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Universeman, SHUT THE FUCK UP
Mon Apr  8 00:24:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't give a damn if you are Jessu Christ
Mon Apr  8 00:25:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zac, make Ellery a wiz
Mon Apr  8 00:27:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unless it is this_player(1) for logging shit :)
Mon Apr  8 00:28:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like, you need to know who your interactive is
Mon Apr  8 00:28:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in case you want to print out the error or say 'weird shit in space
Mon Apr  8 00:28:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your interactive culd be anywhere on the stack
Mon Apr  8 00:28:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and that is *not* a security hole
Mon Apr  8 00:29:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then why bother with the extra cpu to guess at who is interactive
Mon Apr  8 00:29:53 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the weapon has to be designed for 2 hands
Mon Apr  8 00:31:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:simple to tell.. assume this_player() evaluates to an arch and it is not supposed to
Mon Apr  8 00:31:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if that is a problem, you have a whole
Mon Apr  8 00:32:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because anyone can make it happen
Mon Apr  8 00:32:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in other words, if your security relies on this_player() giving you a true value, you have an insecure system
Mon Apr  8 00:33:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this_player() can always be faked as an arch
Mon Apr  8 00:34:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so, if your implementation uses this_player() hoping it can't be faked, you have a hole
Mon Apr  8 00:35:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:init() is a perennial favourite
Mon Apr  8 00:35:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:trans you to my room, put code in init() that does stuff, and viola, you are this_playter()
Mon Apr  8 00:36:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how do you fix that?
Mon Apr  8 00:37:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I have no idea how that thing works
Mon Apr  8 00:37:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't due LPMud
Mon Apr  8 00:37:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err do
Mon Apr  8 00:37:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you should prevent cres from forcing admins
Mon Apr  8 00:37:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:admins have no reason for even being forceable
Mon Apr  8 00:38:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then you have to make sure to check for that flag for every secure operation
Mon Apr  8 00:38:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:massive potential for security holes
Mon Apr  8 00:38:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I honestly doubt you do
Mon Apr  8 00:43:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I make it so you are previosus object as well
Mon Apr  8 00:44:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:find a function that is seemingly innocuous in the player object
Mon Apr  8 00:44:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:again, to protect against this, you have to pay attention to details that are too fine not to miss somewhere
Mon Apr  8 00:47:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you think LPMud security is apain, try securing a distributed mud
Mon Apr  8 00:48:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't with NM IV
Mon Apr  8 00:48:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM IV uses verbs, which must be added centrally
Mon Apr  8 00:48:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you simply write objects which process verb events
Mon Apr  8 00:49:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, NM has a press verb, just inherit LIB_PRESS or something like that
Mon Apr  8 00:50:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are still legacy pieces using it
Mon Apr  8 00:50:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should not be writing new pieces that use it
Mon Apr  8 00:51:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rust would be much better at explaining it than I
Mon Apr  8 00:51:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:he is the bsic author of the system I believe
Mon Apr  8 00:52:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:allowing random creators to add commands with random syntaxes is utter chaos
Mon Apr  8 00:52:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the number one thing people who choose against LPMud complain about
Mon Apr  8 00:52:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you ain;t lostening to intercre, are you Rust?
Mon Apr  8 00:53:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zac just asked me why i removed add_action() from NM
Mon Apr  8 00:53:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I told him you could better explain than I since you are the system's primary architext
Mon Apr  8 00:56:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, but they also hate guessing at syntax when they do not know what it is
Mon Apr  8 00:57:03 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:in other words... is it get apple from basker? get apple from old basket? get the apple from the old basket? get the fruit from the basket?
Mon Apr  8 00:57:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I do :)
Mon Apr  8 00:58:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on NM LPMud (not the mudlib) I require all verbs to go through the mudlib dept
Mon Apr  8 00:58:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the parsing system lets any object add a verb
Mon Apr  8 00:58:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just like to enforce it with a plicy that states all verbs are centrally created
Mon Apr  8 00:58:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since there is no reason for unique creator verbs IMOHO
Mon Apr  8 01:00:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:any number of ways
Mon Apr  8 01:00:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eventForce() or use the sentient.c methods
Mon Apr  8 01:00:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:assuming I don't quit LPMuds, yes
Mon Apr  8 01:02:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so the answer is yes :)
Mon Apr  8 01:02:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is due out with NM V
Mon Apr  8 01:02:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I might even do it next weekend
Mon Apr  8 01:02:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whenever MudOS v22 is released
Mon Apr  8 01:06:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:woo woo, my Java mud is accepting connections
Mon Apr  8 01:07:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would if it knew when you wanted to quit
Mon Apr  8 01:08:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know how to issue SCCS commands from inside emacs?
Mon Apr  8 01:10:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it seems to load something else...
Mon Apr  8 01:12:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have a bunch of vc- commands, but that is not one of them
Mon Apr  8 01:12:52 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:vc-cancel-version, vc-diff, vc-create-snapshot, vc-directory, etc
Mon Apr  8 01:13:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I need to go to bed... I probably should buy the oreilly SCCS book some day and stop playing it by ear
Mon Apr  8 07:22:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that would strike me as a bad idea
Mon Apr  8 07:23:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no such thing
Mon Apr  8 07:23:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no such thing as a highest level
Mon Apr  8 07:26:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:alpha versions by definitiona are undocumented
Mon Apr  8 07:26:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what variable?
Mon Apr  8 07:27:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you set the class, and then set the spells you wish it to use
Mon Apr  8 07:27:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and I am outta here
Mon Apr  8 07:27:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:be seeing you :)
Mon Apr  8 07:28:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for your in/out messages? or soul?
Mon Apr  8 07:28:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that makes no sense
Mon Apr  8 07:29:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, I see
Mon Apr  8 07:29:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no such thing
Mon Apr  8 07:30:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:set the gender for a write command?
Mon Apr  8 07:30:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:write is a method, it has no gender
Mon Apr  8 07:30:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is nothing really to know about domain_stats()
Mon Apr  8 07:31:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and if that is something you are concerned about with a brand new mud, then your priorities are massively skewed
Mon Apr  8 07:31:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the sefun nominative()
Mon Apr  8 07:32:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and dmain_stats() was probably not compiled in with your version of the mudlib cause it won't be supported until IVr2.4
Mon Apr  8 07:34:45 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want FULLL examples write your own damn mudlib
Mon Apr  8 07:36:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gee, Raaza, I have made myself late for work answering your questions
Mon Apr  8 07:36:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so fuck you
Mon Apr  8 07:40:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:dest it and clone another copy
Mon Apr  8 07:41:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am... I just keep getting questions
Tue Apr  9 07:56:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sick people
Tue Apr  9 07:57:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NIN

Tue Apr  9 20:37:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, Caiaphus, I am flattered you spent all evening thinking about me
Tue Apr  9 20:38:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is so rare someone just sits on line all night and talks about me
Tue Apr  9 20:38:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how could I feel other than flattered?
Tue Apr  9 20:39:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then why do you spend all evening talking trash about me?
Tue Apr  9 20:41:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever, Caiaphus, I have a log of it all :)
Tue Apr  9 20:42:41 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they are defined by /daemon/soul

Tue Apr  9 20:49:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Japan is not known for creatinbg technology, they are known for marketing it
Tue Apr  9 20:49:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such thing as 'better'

Tue Apr  9 21:06:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to clarify... this line is for general conversation on any topic suitable for a general audience, intercre is for mud and code related questions
Wed Apr 10 20:48:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, actually it will be
Wed Apr 10 21:19:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Caiaphus, could you please be civil to people?
Wed Apr 10 21:22:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:everyone judges everyone
Wed Apr 10 21:23:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?  my total experience with you comes frm you railing against me after judging me
Wed Apr 10 21:23:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fiancee?
Wed Apr 10 21:24:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, why would I have done that for no reaosn Caiaphus?
Wed Apr 10 21:25:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, no
Wed Apr 10 21:25:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you tore into me because of a conversation I was having with someone else
Wed Apr 10 21:26:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that was after that
Wed Apr 10 21:28:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Caiaphus, I don't call people fuckheads out of the blue, and I remove the conversation
Wed Apr 10 21:28:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err remember
Wed Apr 10 21:29:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why bother?  this is a pointless conversation
Wed Apr 10 23:02:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no

Sun Apr 14 13:24:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:read the FAQ
Sun Apr 14 13:24:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:http://www.imaginary.com/LPMud/lpmud_faq.html
Sun Apr 14 14:55:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no such thing
Sun Apr 14 15:23:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to get Frontiers a new machine?
Sun Apr 14 15:23:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no justification for that
Sun Apr 14 15:24:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the admins would be damn stupid to go out and get you a new machine
Sun Apr 14 15:25:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:none of them go out and buy machines *for muds*
Sun Apr 14 15:26:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:only because they probably *already* had the machien and have nothing betetr to do with it
Sun Apr 14 15:26:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if the circumstances are otherwise, you school's computing department has skewed priorities
Sun Apr 14 15:28:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am not against mudding, I am saying it is not worth a college spending its resources on
Sun Apr 14 15:29:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a pitaance that could be spent on putting another kid through school
Sun Apr 14 15:29:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are much better things to do with that pittance than buy a machine for a game
Sun Apr 14 15:30:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I did not say to scrap everything
Sun Apr 14 15:30:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:clearly it makes sense if they have an old unused machine lying around to let a mud run on it
Sun Apr 14 15:31:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but going out to fund a mud is completely insane
Sun Apr 14 15:31:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want someone to spend money on a mud for you, do it yourself
Sun Apr 14 15:32:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you sound like a spoiled little brat, and this belongs on intergossip
Sun Apr 14 15:32:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the school has no business funding muds
Sun Apr 14 15:32:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:*especially* if it is a public university
Sun Apr 14 15:33:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, because you sound like a spoiled brat
Sun Apr 14 15:33:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how can you conceive of justifying the spending of $2,000 on a GAME when some students don't have computers to do their papers on?
Sun Apr 14 15:34:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever Cratylus, your opinion of me does not phaze me
Sun Apr 14 15:34:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hell no Hanzou, what he wants is immoral
Sun Apr 14 15:35:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Cratylus, who the hell do you think I am?
Sun Apr 14 15:35:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know exactly what has been done with muds
Sun Apr 14 15:35:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:getting them to spend $2,000 on a game is immoral
Sun Apr 14 15:35:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I act like who I am
Sun Apr 14 15:36:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because that $2,000 could be much better spent
Sun Apr 14 15:36:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no justification for spending it on a mud
Sun Apr 14 15:36:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you are arguing with a huge mud advopcate right now
Sun Apr 14 15:36:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I bought my computer with my money, not someone else's
Sun Apr 14 15:37:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially not with someone else's which had a dedicated purpose to it
Sun Apr 14 15:37:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, the students pay for education
Sun Apr 14 15:37:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only possible way to get the college to fund it would be to start up a student organization
Sun Apr 14 15:38:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, on my school, those were funded through student organizations
Sun Apr 14 15:38:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is different
Sun Apr 14 15:38:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you are not proposing a student organization
Sun Apr 14 15:38:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just want someone to give you a computer so you can play games
Sun Apr 14 15:39:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I ran a freakin student organization in college, I know how funding works
Sun Apr 14 15:39:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, my argument does not insanely support muds as the answer to world problems
Sun Apr 14 15:40:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I know where muds lie on the priority list
Sun Apr 14 15:40:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and they are somewhere close to nowhere on that list from a computing department point of view
Sun Apr 14 15:41:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I never said there was no educational benefit
Sun Apr 14 15:41:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i learned to code on muds
Sun Apr 14 15:41:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but that does not justify *spending money* to support them
Sun Apr 14 15:41:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:from a collegel point of view
Sun Apr 14 15:42:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and it is the height of arrogance to suggest somehow that someone else should be responsible for funding your fun and games
Sun Apr 14 15:44:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rigel, them giving you bandwidth costs them nothing
Sun Apr 14 15:44:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:asking a U for bandiwdth when you supply the equipment is cool
Sun Apr 14 15:44:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and there is no real reason for the school not to allow it
Sun Apr 14 15:45:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:line costs?
Sun Apr 14 15:45:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why not co-locate with campus machines?
Sun Apr 14 15:48:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't think the U should fund your dedicated line
Sun Apr 14 15:52:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should never need to touch your server
Sun Apr 14 15:52:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM's server is in eden prairie MN, and moving to downtown minneapolis... I see it once maybe every 3 months
Sun Apr 14 16:03:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone know what URS form to fill out to file an extension?
Sun Apr 14 16:15:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is proper network support?>
Sun Apr 14 16:15:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and you can have X on windows 95
Sun Apr 14 16:15:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and there are a bijillion free apps for windows
Sun Apr 14 16:15:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:windows 95 has free java
Sun Apr 14 16:16:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my network code on widnows 95 seems quite stable
Sun Apr 14 16:16:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for exchange, who needs an smtp gateway for exchange?
Sun Apr 14 16:16:48 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, because windows 95 is not good for running amud :)
Sun Apr 14 16:17:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don;t nbeed the gateway to exchange
Sun Apr 14 16:18:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I manage to mail to the internet just fine
Sun Apr 14 16:18:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't HAVE to use Exchange
Sun Apr 14 16:18:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, Windows 95 is a single user operating system
Sun Apr 14 16:19:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the conversation is about windows 95 and linux for your desktop
Sun Apr 14 21:59:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone here using ISDN?
Sun Apr 14 22:03:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:$189/month unlimited 128k
Sun Apr 14 22:03:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:US Wets is horrible
Sun Apr 14 22:04:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where inside their domain do you live?
Sun Apr 14 22:04:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I complained to one of thei reps about their service nce
Sun Apr 14 22:05:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:told them the minute AT&T offered local service, I was walking
Sun Apr 14 22:05:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the rep said he was too
Sun Apr 14 22:05:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is not a joke... he really said that to me
Sun Apr 14 22:05:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:said nothing they could do about how incompetent the people in Denver were
Sun Apr 14 22:06:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for?
Sun Apr 14 22:06:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:unlimited?
Sun Apr 14 22:06:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which local bell
Sun Apr 14 22:07:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hell, the school I graduated from has all dorms wired ethernet
Sun Apr 14 22:07:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and they install ethernet cards without charge
Sun Apr 14 22:08:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I graduated before people knew what the net was :)
Sun Apr 14 22:08:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so I did not benefit from that feature
Sun Apr 14 22:09:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course, the tuition for the school is around $25,000 per year :)
Sun Apr 14 22:09:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so either that is a cool feature, or expensive internet access :)
Sun Apr 14 22:09:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Bates College
Sun Apr 14 22:09:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we had maid service as well :)
Mon Apr 15 23:21:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is not a chat channel
Mon Apr 15 23:22:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well stop chatting garbage on it
Mon Apr 15 23:24:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you need to find what error -22 is in docket.h I think
Mon Apr 15 23:24:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:huh?
Mon Apr 15 23:25:38 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmmm... what OS?
Mon Apr 15 23:26:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahh, never mind, you mean LPC?
Mon Apr 15 23:26:20 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it means you are trying to write to a cblocking socket
Mon Apr 15 23:26:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is what intergossip is
Mon Apr 15 23:26:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it should not happen though
Mon Apr 15 23:26:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should be waiting for a write callback
Mon Apr 15 23:27:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and only then writing
Mon Apr 15 23:27:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I was referring to the dude using intercre to look for someone
Mon Apr 15 23:28:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, what is happening is that you open a connection and start writing to it
Mon Apr 15 23:28:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for whatever reason, the buffer is filling, which is normal
Mon Apr 15 23:28:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is abnoramal (i.e. nbad socket code) is you are continuing to try to write instead of waiting for a write callback
Mon Apr 15 23:28:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have way too much faith in people Mongar
Mon Apr 15 23:29:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:where does it say we have no right to define content for these lines?
Mon Apr 15 23:30:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:we do not dictate content, only content on the channels we sponsor
Mon Apr 15 23:31:06 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:setting up your own channel is part of the spec
Mon Apr 15 23:32:58 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:easily... the stuff is not necessarily going through a central server
Mon Apr 15 23:33:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for details, read the spec
Mon Apr 15 23:33:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sponsoring a channel means simly adding a ne wone
Mon Apr 15 23:33:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the router does not scontent monitoring, it is just a carrier
Mon Apr 15 23:33:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the idea exchange is the sponsor of the imud_code and imud_gossip channels, and thus defines the cntent for them
Mon Apr 15 23:34:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:similarly, you could define a kriton_is_god channel and allow only people who actively worship you to take part
Mon Apr 15 23:35:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is being worked on :)
Mon Apr 15 23:35:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only mud that has gotten in trouble with it was seriously over any line of common sense
Mon Apr 15 23:36:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:StarMUD
Mon Apr 15 23:36:45 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:EoTL has never been on here
Mon Apr 15 23:37:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they have been? ack
Mon Apr 15 23:38:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I guess I need soem sleep
Mon Apr 15 23:38:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:night :)
Tue Apr 16 10:50:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ask on intergossip

Tue Apr 16 22:42:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:maybe Heaven, if you would shut up and listen, you would not be so confused 1005 of the time
Tue Apr 16 22:43:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Heaven, you act like we can enforce what muds do on their own muds
Tue Apr 16 22:43:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Narek, you are damn straight I am getting hostile

Tue Apr 16 22:46:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Heaven, I have stated the rules sebveral; times
Tue Apr 16 22:46:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you just have not heard one word I have said... several of you just want to interpret some sort of violation of your rights here
Tue Apr 16 22:47:11 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the rules are vague
Tue Apr 16 22:47:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:#1 I don't know where they are written dfown
Tue Apr 16 22:47:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:your obsessive insistance on seeing them written down does not change that they exist or what they are
Tue Apr 16 22:48:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Othila, I can't do any such thing
Tue Apr 16 22:48:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one can control what any mud does internally
Tue Apr 16 22:48:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because I say they exist is good enough
Tue Apr 16 22:49:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I make up the rules, and I say a rule exist, yes, it is good enough
Tue Apr 16 22:49:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wuth respect to intergossip, IdeaExchange makes up the rules
Tue Apr 16 22:50:14 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Wraith and Karna... that is exactly the crap that is pissing me off
Tue Apr 16 22:50:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Heaven, I am an administrator of IdeaExchange
Tue Apr 16 22:50:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Othila, am i very likely to make up rules willy-nilly?
Tue Apr 16 22:51:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what was wraith's answer?
Tue Apr 16 22:51:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:i gave you frewaking rules
Tue Apr 16 22:52:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is correct
Tue Apr 16 22:52:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:every intermud channel is sponsored by some mud
Tue Apr 16 22:52:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Heaven, if they violate the rules, I will tell them
Tue Apr 16 22:52:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the problem is everyone's moronic insistance in arguing the point here
Tue Apr 16 22:53:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there was no freaking trial
Tue Apr 16 22:54:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you guys were talking in terms that bordered on violation, and I pointed it out
Tue Apr 16 22:54:23 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one was removed or anythiung else
Tue Apr 16 22:54:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because you were ascting like it?
Tue Apr 16 22:55:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:debating freedom of speech calling me a dic\tator, demanding I post the rules before you would follow them
Tue Apr 16 22:55:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Wraith, shut the hell up
Tue Apr 16 22:56:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no, that was Karna
Tue Apr 16 22:56:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I were prone to ban people on a whim, don't you think I would have banned the lot of you by now?
Tue Apr 16 22:57:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it will be put on the web if it is not alrerady
Tue Apr 16 22:57:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to my knowledge it is on www.imaginary.com somewhre as is
Tue Apr 16 22:58:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and like I said, if my personal will determined who got banished, your mud would be #1 on the list wraoith
Tue Apr 16 22:59:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bs, people were arguing what the rules were
Tue Apr 16 23:00:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:as if i were making them up and shit
Tue Apr 16 23:00:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and Wraith, I am actually looking to see if i can find them
Tue Apr 16 23:00:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that does not follow Wraith
Tue Apr 16 23:01:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:here they are...

Tue Apr 16 23:04:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you want to keep it up Narek?
Tue Apr 16 23:05:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Narek, Wraith
Tue Apr 16 23:05:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Wraith is trying to do nothing other than be argumentative, same with Narek
Tue Apr 16 23:06:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because they are being drowned out by the droning of jerks like Wraith and Narek
Tue Apr 16 23:07:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there is no clear definition
Tue Apr 16 23:07:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one is going to be suddenly booted without warning

Tue Apr 16 23:18:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and unfortunately my scroll only goes back to where you started asking for rule clarifications when I was reading them
Tue Apr 16 23:23:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, the impression I am left with is that you were rude, however, i will assume you were not and I just got that image from being barraged by tons of rudeness
Tue Apr 16 23:23:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:therefore, I am sorry

Tue Apr 23 20:03:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that has nothing to do with the question asked
Tue Apr 23 20:04:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Mogwi: I am not sure... that board object is technically not supported
Tue Apr 23 20:05:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:my first guess is that security prevents it
Tue Apr 23 20:06:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but inside the mappings they contain strings

Tue Apr 23 20:31:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is exactly the style in which NM is coded
Tue Apr 23 20:31:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Tue Apr 23 20:31:53 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you don't need to prototype inherited methods
Tue Apr 23 20:32:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you want to create an abstract method?
Tue Apr 23 20:33:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, what you want to do is fine... NM does it all over the place
Tue Apr 23 20:37:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I told you it was fine :)
Tue Apr 23 22:27:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope, makes no difference
Tue Apr 23 22:27:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:all methods are public by default
Tue Apr 23 22:28:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nomask means you cannot override it
Tue Apr 23 22:33:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:public is antithetical to private and nomask
Tue Apr 23 22:33:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err private and static
Tue Apr 23 22:34:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does not have to be there :)
Tue Apr 23 23:02:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are no such things as points in LPC
Tue Apr 23 23:02:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:* is an array
Tue Apr 23 23:09:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not until some bugs are fixed in mudos
Tue Apr 23 23:14:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes
Tue Apr 23 23:16:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is your question?
Tue Apr 23 23:17:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are just string myfunc(string *arr);
Tue Apr 23 23:18:05 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:boggle, just the part starting with string :)
Tue Apr 23 23:19:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are passing an array as an argument
Tue Apr 23 23:21:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no pointers are in LPC
Tue Apr 23 23:21:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a reference
Tue Apr 23 23:23:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:pointer and reference are very different concepts
Tue Apr 23 23:23:38 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a pointer is a dangerous thing, a reference only someone dangerous
Tue Apr 23 23:23:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err somewhat
Tue Apr 23 23:24:08 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is right
Tue Apr 23 23:24:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:a reference references a specific object
Tue Apr 23 23:25:09 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:LPC does not allow access to memory addresses
Tue Apr 23 23:25:35 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is identical to Java
Tue Apr 23 23:26:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, it is fairly cool
Tue Apr 23 23:26:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it would make the mud crash prone and it would make it impossible to make it secure
Tue Apr 23 23:27:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:28K is plenty fast
Tue Apr 23 23:27:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and yes, Java is a lot like LPC
Tue Apr 23 23:28:38 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oops, yes, Java is a lot like LPC
Tue Apr 23 23:28:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and 28K is plenty fast
Tue Apr 23 23:30:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bah, that is nonsense
Tue Apr 23 23:30:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I run win95 on a 486-33
Tue Apr 23 23:35:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Windows 95 is actually a very good operating system
Tue Apr 23 23:35:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you want a real operating system that is
Tue Apr 23 23:36:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:linux is hardly capable of running serious business applications
Tue Apr 23 23:36:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:sounds like a personal configuration issue Nimbus
Tue Apr 23 23:36:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Win95 interfaces is the best UI out there
Tue Apr 23 23:37:12 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:never had explorer crash personally
Tue Apr 23 23:37:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the only apps ever crashed my system is corel draw 4
Tue Apr 23 23:37:53 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:inconsistent?
Tue Apr 23 23:38:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it just allows you multiple ways for doing the same task
Tue Apr 23 23:38:19 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:linux is not an OS for serious server apps
Tue Apr 23 23:38:47 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nonsense
Tue Apr 23 23:38:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:must be a monkey ISP
Tue Apr 23 23:39:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it should be on intergossip
Tue Apr 23 23:39:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:linux is not capable of doing that... I build business applications, and it could not handle the task of running those things
Tue Apr 23 23:40:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Logic, I know my UNIX damn well
Tue Apr 23 23:40:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Linux will do fine as a weenie network server and basic user shell machine
Tue Apr 23 23:41:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Rassilon thre tier database applications spread across multiple servers
Tue Apr 23 23:41:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fuck the existence of database ports
Tue Apr 23 23:42:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is incapable of handling the load
Tue Apr 23 23:42:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how is that Logic?
Tue Apr 23 23:42:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you running mSQL and some dweebie CGIs scripts?
Tue Apr 23 23:43:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is NOT load Logic
Tue Apr 23 23:44:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:news is not even load compared to shit I am talking about
Tue Apr 23 23:45:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:eh, Sybase is probably worse than Oracle... Oracle has their shit together relatively speaking
Tue Apr 23 23:45:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:heh :)
Tue Apr 23 23:45:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, you can get personal oracle for free :)
Tue Apr 23 23:47:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bah, almost everyone used to wwork for Oracle and left at one time or another :)
Tue Apr 23 23:48:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:damn straight, Sybase rocks Ingres big time
Tue Apr 23 23:48:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:outdated because CA bought it
Tue Apr 23 23:48:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Sybase can't scale
Tue Apr 23 23:49:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Sybase is dead if System 11 does not fix that
Tue Apr 23 23:50:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:people who can't afford Oracle go to Ingres
Tue Apr 23 23:50:21 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually... I am very interested in Informix right now
Tue Apr 23 23:50:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:their UDS should rock big time
Tue Apr 23 23:50:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't give a damn about current Informix release
Tue Apr 23 23:51:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the Universal Data Server... next release merges Illustra OORDBMS with informix
Tue Apr 23 23:51:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:imagine being able to do things like write your stored procs in Java
Tue Apr 23 23:52:13 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:peculiar
Tue Apr 23 23:52:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but the thing is, that you can basically rewrite the DBMS kernal without affecting its stability
Tue Apr 23 23:53:08 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is the OO part of it
Tue Apr 23 23:54:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, i would like to see Hosuton against the Bulls... I think that would be an awesome championship
Tue Apr 23 23:54:54 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:different companies... I am a consultant
Tue Apr 23 23:55:36 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not bad :)
Tue Apr 23 23:56:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mostly I think it is fun to be able to do different things
Tue Apr 23 23:57:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rather than working on a single product line for some software company, or worse, working for sme lame IS staff
Tue Apr 23 23:58:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:those sound like good numbers :)  I really can't give out my companies rates though
Tue Apr 23 23:59:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think web page builders even go as low as $30-$40
Tue Apr 23 23:59:22 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and those people are generally independent consultants
Wed Apr 24 00:00:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well... you have to double your hourly intake in order to make the same living as an indie
Wed Apr 24 00:00:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:so that means someone getting $30 as an independent takes home roughly what they would get delivering pizza full time
Wed Apr 24 00:01:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:assuming the pizza company had health, dental, etc :)
Wed Apr 24 00:02:10 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:right
Wed Apr 24 00:02:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and the talent they have to do that is enough to get hired at a place which would give them more take home I wuld think
Wed Apr 24 00:02:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which is what makes me boggle :)
Wed Apr 24 00:03:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I think that is important stuff :)
Wed Apr 24 00:03:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone here going to javaOne?
Wed Apr 24 00:04:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:JavaOne is in SF :)
Wed Apr 24 00:05:27 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Java rocks :)
Wed Apr 24 00:05:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:May 29-31
Wed Apr 24 00:05:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the speed will be fixed... Sun's life depends on it
Wed Apr 24 00:08:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I exaggerate... but the point is the success of Java is important to them, so they will make sure it speeds up
Wed Apr 24 00:15:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, no, I have never actually seen COBOL
Wed Apr 24 00:15:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have done C, C++, PowerBlower, and Java
Wed Apr 24 00:16:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:name one thing to like about it?
Wed Apr 24 00:16:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is simply the slowest, most instable piece of trash ever passed off as tested software
Wed Apr 24 00:17:25 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is a horrible development environment, and it builds crash prone apps
Wed Apr 24 00:17:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am sure PowerBlower access oracle through ODBC must make for plenty of time to play minesweeper
Wed Apr 24 21:04:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, I agree with what Beek said... I only prototype every method because hundreds of people are reading my code
Wed Apr 24 21:04:27 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for any possible use you have, there is no need to prototype every method
Wed Apr 24 21:32:13 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, Luinil is right
Wed Apr 24 21:32:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:mappings of classes are very very messy
Wed Apr 24 21:47:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, why?
Wed Apr 24 21:48:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:even if you want somethign as simple as having the desc depend on day or night>
Wed Apr 24 21:49:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but you should be able to conditionally have the description depend on the current circumstances
Wed Apr 24 21:50:33 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not in Lima
Wed Apr 24 21:53:16 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:avoiding add_action is good... I think Mongar means the ability to have a dynamic item descritpion
Thu Apr 25 19:29:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, a person has the right to allow the use of their code as they see fit
Thu Apr 25 19:29:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have no business stealing their code
Sun Apr 28 09:12:40 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this channel is not for that
Sun Apr 28 09:15:59 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if you guys can't learn how to use this channel properly, you won't be using it at all
Sun Apr 28 09:16:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this is the code channel, not the hi channel, and not the nameless sorrows channel
Sun Apr 28 09:17:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is supposed to be unused unless you have a code question
Sun Apr 28 09:17:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:50%
Sun Apr 28 09:18:22 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:50%
Sun Apr 28 09:18:54 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:50%
Sun Apr 28 09:19:18 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it generates 0 or 1
Sun Apr 28 09:21:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hello.... I am the guy who wrote the textbook son LPC
Sun Apr 28 09:22:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:wonders if everyone at Nameless Sorrows is so mentally challenged.
Sun Apr 28 09:22:49 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:5 minutes where you have not said anything stypud
Sun Apr 28 09:23:23 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:whatever :)
Sun Apr 28 12:12:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:speak for yourself Vitacha
Sun Apr 28 12:13:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:congradulations Prometheus, here's a cookie
Sun Apr 28 12:14:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I would not be caught dead reading such a book :)
Sun Apr 28 12:14:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Valentino, I don't give a flying fuck about the core file
Sun Apr 28 12:15:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Prometheus, why do you need to be such an ass?
Sun Apr 28 12:15:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:why is it embarassing?
Sun Apr 28 12:15:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it is an extra file
Sun Apr 28 12:15:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just rm the damn thing
Sun Apr 28 12:16:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:may I ask to what end you are getting on my case Valentino?
Sun Apr 28 12:16:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone judging an entire mudlib cause it has a core file in it is a flaming idiot
Sun Apr 28 12:17:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and quite honestly, I have better things to do than untar it, remove the core file, and tar it back up
Sun Apr 28 12:17:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:well, I am not embarassed
Sun Apr 28 12:18:15 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bite me Zara, you have no idea
Sun Apr 28 12:19:00 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:then don't download it
Sun Apr 28 12:19:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zara is using a NM 3.* lib
Sun Apr 28 12:19:50 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zara: here is a suggestion, don't use it
Sun Apr 28 12:20:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:especially a bunch of two bit programmers criticizing his code
Sun Apr 28 12:21:12 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zara no
Sun Apr 28 12:21:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM is nothing like tmi
Sun Apr 28 12:22:19 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:gee, Valentino, I have 5 people giving me random shit for no reason, you expect me to be a keen guy in the face of that?
Sun Apr 28 12:22:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Zara you weould not have a freaking mud if it weere not for me
Sun Apr 28 12:23:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:haughty attitude because I wnated to charge you cost for running a mud?
Sun Apr 28 12:24:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Nightmare is as good as Lima
Sun Apr 28 12:24:34 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you are not using the current release of NM
Sun Apr 28 12:25:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:object model is the fundmental differentce
Sun Apr 28 12:27:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that and the fact that NM may no longer exist in a few weeks if this constant rain of shit does not stop
Sun Apr 28 12:27:41 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they have the same basic design principles though, with some different focuses
Sun Apr 28 12:28:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Lima is more administration oriented
Sun Apr 28 12:28:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it has tons of admin features
Sun Apr 28 12:28:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:NM has a lot of player features
Sun Apr 28 15:48:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:let them drink coffee!
Sun Apr 28 15:56:16 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:they should know not to jump... but birdies tmept them, I can tell :)
Sun Apr 28 17:56:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:technically it is undefined
Sun Apr 28 17:59:01 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:there are reasons besides messiness why not to do it though :)
Sun Apr 28 17:59:31 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:such as being able to dynamically add stats and skills
Sun Apr 28 18:00:07 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if they are in a class, a code change is required to addd a new stat or skill
Sun Apr 28 18:00:34 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ahhh
Sun Apr 28 18:00:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that makes sense
Sun Apr 28 18:01:58 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the class thing mroe efficient?  I think so
Sun Apr 28 18:03:00 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange: replacing the whol skills mapping though is not a good idea since it limits your ability to dynamically add classes
Sun Apr 28 18:03:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:basically, use classes where you have a structure that will never change
Sun Apr 28 18:21:28 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the bulls lead miami by 30 pts in the 3rd quarter
Sun Apr 28 18:24:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:rodman gets 2 technicals... again...
Sun Apr 28 18:30:29 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:me getting kicked?
Sun Apr 28 19:34:57 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh no, my brains
Sun Apr 28 21:05:25 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:is there anyone who would be interested in testing the F IIr1.1 install?
Sun Apr 28 21:12:29 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:okie, it will be out on the ftp site in like 5 minutes :) I aprpeciate it :)
Sun Apr 28 21:19:44 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because this is for code testing
Sun Apr 28 21:20:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:just what I said
Sun Apr 28 21:21:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you asked what I was doing on intercre, and I said asking someone to test my code
Sun Apr 28 21:30:05 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:for those of you giving me shit about the core file in the mudlib: removing it made no difference in the gzipped release
Sun Apr 28 21:30:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the latest release of Foundation is now available
Mon Apr 29 14:09:33 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what do you mean by promotion?
Mon Apr 29 22:30:57 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the question?
Mon Apr 29 22:32:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:varargs fun(object obj, mixed *args...)
Mon Apr 29 22:34:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes, you need the return type
Mon Apr 29 22:34:26 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and bingo, that is exactly what happens
Mon Apr 29 22:46:01 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:can I buy a vowel?

Thu May  2 18:05:39 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:fix it please :)
Thu May  2 18:07:31 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:was it funny?
Thu May  2 18:16:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Thu May  2 18:22:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:who exactly would listen to a test channel?
Thu May  2 18:22:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:having one would automatically render it useless :)
Thu May  2 18:23:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:go ahead and code :)
Thu May  2 21:09:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:anyone see DS9 this week?  The Muse?

Thu May  2 21:29:56 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:when in doubt about things like that, give the ole eval command a shot
Thu May  2 22:10:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:-
Thu May  2 22:13:37 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that means f is 0
Thu May  2 22:16:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ok, 0.0
Fri May  3 17:34:09 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is annoying
Fri May  3 17:36:20 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:apache is a paing
Fri May  3 17:36:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:or a pain

Fri May  3 17:40:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Voyager SUCKS!!!!!!!
Fri May  3 17:42:44 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:if I wrote a book, would you all buy it? :)
Fri May  3 17:43:24 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:on Java?
Fri May  3 17:43:42 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:too bad :(
Fri May  3 17:44:07 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what if I make Nightmare X a Java mud? :)
Fri May  3 17:44:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:actually, I proposed one on LPC, and it was *almost* accepted
Fri May  3 17:44:51 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but then they decided it would not sell enough copies :(
Fri May  3 17:44:59 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:ayuh, this was O'Reilly
Fri May  3 17:46:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I will redo the LPC stuff (with advanced stuff) in HTML this summer
Fri May  3 17:46:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:still, there is nothinglike a hardcopy reference by your side
Fri May  3 17:46:53 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you have to understand, I wrote the first two books in ed :)
Fri May  3 17:47:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:err, I have much more sphisticated tools at my disposal in 1996 :)
Fri May  3 17:48:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I actually intend to write it in HTML using some sort of authoring tool that will do spell checking
Fri May  3 17:48:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Netscape Gold does not do spell checking
Fri May  3 17:48:52 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Word does not do proper web page authoring
Fri May  3 17:50:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:hmm... maybe I should write one
Fri May  3 18:22:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:this channel is regulated, and that was way out of line
Fri May  3 18:28:36 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:did you try typing 'tap'?
Fri May  3 18:29:10 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what happened is what happens
Fri May  3 18:34:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I just colourized Citizen Kane
Fri May  3 18:35:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Ted Turner got all hot and bothers
Fri May  3 18:35:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bothered

Fri May  3 18:37:37 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:put a piece of metal in your head you said, make you dead, make you hippa hippa hippa
Fri May  3 18:38:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:now, how would you have ever been allowe don the line if that were the case?
Fri May  3 19:16:02 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you know how to change the font on a web page?
Fri May  3 19:16:32 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:thanks :)'
Fri May  3 19:16:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope, that did not do it
Fri May  3 19:18:49 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I can try
Fri May  3 19:19:03 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:nope
Fri May  3 19:19:17 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not: NAME, COMMAND, FONTNAME, FACE, TYPEFACE
Fri May  3 19:21:40 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:help help!
Fri May  3 19:21:50 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:how about here, anyone know how to set the font in HTML
Fri May  3 19:22:48 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I have seeb\n it somewhere :)
Fri May  3 19:23:04 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:of course you ca't, but you can try
Fri May  3 19:23:53 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no not the body one :)
Fri May  3 19:24:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no
Fri May  3 19:24:51 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:<BASEFONT SIZE=blah>
Fri May  3 19:29:47 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it can't be just an internet explorer deal
Fri May  3 19:29:55 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I don't touch the piece of crap
Fri May  3 19:36:21 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no idea
Fri May  3 19:36:59 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yes :)
Fri May  3 19:38:01 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:player channels are banned at this time
Fri May  3 19:38:39 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yep... that is a I3 prohibition
Fri May  3 19:38:51 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:bring it up on the intermud mailig list if you want it changed
Fri May  3 19:39:22 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:intermud@imaginary.com
Fri May  3 19:39:30 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you should probably join the list first
Fri May  3 19:39:52 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what trend is that?
Fri May  3 19:40:16 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what about imaginary.com?
Fri May  3 19:40:38 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what is the trend?
Fri May  3 19:41:04 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Microsoft is not on imaginary.com :)
Fri May  3 19:41:08 1996:  ichat: Descartes@IdeaExchange:oh, LPMud :)
Mon May  6 17:52:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it does a lot
Mon May  6 17:57:17 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:probably SetInventory()
Mon May  6 17:57:39 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:but I am making an extremely rough guess as to what you mean
Mon May  6 17:58:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:something like it is in NM, have a look at the room docs :)
Mon May  6 18:00:28 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:yeah, I do foreach(object ob in objects()) if( base_name(ob) == file) count++;
Mon May  6 18:03:15 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the format for SetInventory() depends on the object in question, best to refer to the docs ont hat
Mon May  6 18:03:43 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:you ddon't do that witht eh NM mudlib
Mon May  6 18:03:55 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:/doc/build
Mon May  6 18:04:45 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I will sacrifice a little efficiency for understandbility any day
Mon May  6 18:06:06 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:because that does not mean they should never be called
Mon May  6 18:06:24 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:and actually, keeping things in their own files can be more efficien\t maybe
Mon May  6 18:06:30 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:since you never have to write resets
Mon May  6 18:06:42 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:which means the rooms are always replaced
Mon May  6 18:07:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:although that is a random theory and I have no idea if it is truly more efficient overall :)
Mon May  6 18:07:46 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:the most important reason is that from a code maintainence point of view, ob->set() is hell
Mon May  6 18:11:52 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:absolute_value(x)
Mon May  6 18:12:02 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:to_int(f);
Mon May  6 18:14:14 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:Beek has an LPC fix, no idea how fast it is
Mon May  6 18:15:21 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that is correct, because of a change made to mudos a few released back
Mon May  6 18:17:11 1996:  imud_code: Descartes@IdeaExchange:like I said, Beek has an LPC fix, but I have no idea how fast it is
Mon May  6 18:17:43 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:not a very useful class since you are using a version of NM that no longer exists :)
Mon May  6 18:18:26 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:no one new is using
Mon May  6 18:18:30 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:it
Mon May  6 18:19:04 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:tribbles
Mon May  6 18:20:18 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:what are tribbles?
Mon May  6 18:20:38 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I KNow what they are
Mon May  6 18:20:46 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:I am just curious what about them is lagging the mud
Mon May  6 18:20:56 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:reproduction?
Mon May  6 18:21:35 1996:  imud_gossip: Descartes@IdeaExchange:that will do it
