Welcome to Dysfunctional Mud!

* Any mail for the mud can be sent to the following addresses:
      rockford@novia.net, astasia@iastate.edu (Tim)
      kyricc@inetnebr.com (Kyricc)
      scott@de.msstate.edu (Quint)

* I am working on a new FTP server for the mud.  Right now you should be able
  to get and put files in both ASCII and BINARY mode.  Try it out if you get
  a chance and report any bugs to me.  (port: 4443) --Tim

* Check out my ~tim/TODO list for things that need to be done.  New items are
  usually added to the bottom of the list.

* I moved some directories around, mostly stuff got moved into /adm.
  There is a new include dir there, simul_efun stuff got moved into
  /adm/obj/daemon where it should be, as did the /obj/daemon/net directory.
  Save files got changed a little too.
