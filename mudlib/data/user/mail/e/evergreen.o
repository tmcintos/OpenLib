I'd suggest allowing ~d to take one argument that is a linenumber (or possibly a range?) and creating a command ~a (add after) whichtakes one argument that is a line (could be zero) after which to add text.  Also, I think function pointers have changed some since v21.00 so youcan check out /doc/driver/lpc/types/function if you haven't seen the newerstyle ones (there are 4 different types).  At first I was worried about getting extra arguments to the call func,but I guess those can be passed in the function pointer.later,Tim",/),(/0,"Tim","sorry about the double message","To: evergreenFrom: TimDate: Mon Jan 22 21:23:12 1996Subject: sorry about the double messageCC: BCC: tim-------There was apparently a bug in my logic in the mail system.  Actually ifsomeone didn't have a mailbox save file yet then the messages from theprevious mailbox were not zeroed out.  The problem should be fixed now.later,Tim",/),(/0,"Tim","Editor","To: evergreenFrom: TimDate: Wed Jan 24 22:40:24 1996Subject: EditorCC: BCC: -------How's the editor coming?  I glanced at the code but didn't have time toread it through to see where you were at...what I saw looks good.  Theonly thing I thought is you might want to replace the (*var_name)() syntaxwith an evaluate() call...they are equivalent, but I've got a feeling theformer may be phased out of MudOS eventually.",/),})
